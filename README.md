# Nuxt Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Package manager and runtime

We are using [Bun](https://bun.sh) as our package manager and runtime for scripts.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
bun run dev # or just bun dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
bun run build # full 'bun run' prefix required as bun has an internal build param
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
bun run preview # or just bun preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
