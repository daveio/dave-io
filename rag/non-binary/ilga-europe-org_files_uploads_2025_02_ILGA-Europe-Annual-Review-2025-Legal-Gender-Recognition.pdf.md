LEGAL GENDER RECOGNITION ALBANIA Despite numerous recommendations directed at Albania, a legal framework for gender recognition remains absent in the country. This deficiency leaves many trans people without essential documentation that accurately reflects their gender identity, perpetuating discrimination and stigmatisation while also limiting access to healthcare and other critical services. The Ministry of Health and Social Protection introduced a new Medical Protocol on Hormonal Treatment for Trans People, but effective implementation necessitates further capacity building among medical professionals to ensure they can provide appropriate support to trans people.
In September, Aleanca LGBTI commenced a strategic litigation case seeking legal recognition of a trans woman'Äôs gender identity before the Civil Court of First Instance of Tirana. Simultaneously, Ylberofilia, in collaboration with the Albanian Committee of Helsinki, continues to advocate in court for the right to amend personal information on identity cards.
BELARUS Monitoring conducted by TG House from 2019 to 2024 has highlighted systemic issues within the Gender Transition Commission in Belarus, revealing a significant increase in rejection rates for gender transition applications. Notably, during the first commission meeting in 2024, 80% of applicants were denied. The monitoring also uncovered widespread procedural inconsistencies, lack of transparency, and discriminatory practices, including arbitrary criteria for decision-making. These barriers have forced many trans people to abandon their efforts or seek assistance abroad, exacerbating the challenges faced by the trans community in accessing legal gender recognition. TG House also documented a case in 2024 where a trans man in Belarus faced coercion from officials to abandon his gender transition. He reported significant pressure, including threats of losing access to essential documents and social services. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA The Federal Ministry of Health is blocking the process on the improvement of the legal gender recognition provisions in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though they received five letters from various governmental institutions. BULGARIA In July, the European Court of Human Rights overturned the decision on the revision of the Y.T v Bulgaria case, emphasising that Bulgaria is obliged to set up a robust legal framework for legal gender recognition. Nonetheless, there remains a total ban on legal gender recognition in Bulgaria.
CROATIA 2024 marked the 10th anniversary of the Regulation on legal gender recognition, with official data available from the implementation of the regulation until the end of 2023. According to the data, fewer than 200 people have completed the process and, while requests for legal gender recognition are being processed, the procedures remain lengthy, burdensome, and often exceed legal time limits.
The Constitutional Court dismissed the request of the U Ime Obitelji organisation to review the constitutionality of the Law on Civil Registries and the associated Regulation on legal gender recognition. NORTHEN CYPRUS A case was recorded of a trans man who successfully updated his Turkish and southern Cyprus identification documents in line with his gender identity but faced difficulties with northern Cyprus documents. The case underscored how the lack of harmonisation between jurisdictions creates significant challenges for trans individuals seeking legal recognition.
CZECHIA The Constitutional Court has repealed a regulation that mandated surgical procedures, including sterilisation and genital transformation, as prerequisites for legal gender recognition for trans people. The court found that these legal requirements violated the fundamental rights of trans people, specifically their right to bodily integrity and personal autonomy, as well as their human dignity.
However, the court has postponed the enforceability of this decision until July 1, 2025, allowing the Czech government time to incorporate the ruling into law. Meanwhile, the trans organisation Transparent has reported that the government is falling behind in this process and may be exploring methods to circumvent the ruling and implement alternative restrictions on legal gender recognition.
DENMARK In September, Denmark celebrated the 10th anniversary of a reform that eliminated the outdated requirement for surgical procedures to change one'Äôs legal gender. In September, Danish media reported the case of a trans woman who, despite her legal gender recognition, was placed in a male prison and experienced strip searches by male staff. The woman in question, convicted of crimes including rape, challenged her placement in a male ward, citing violations of her privacy and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Supreme Court ruled that the placement decision, based on her criminal history and risk assessment, did not breach her privacy Back to index <--> THEMES rights. Furthermore, it determined that strip searches conducted by male staff did not violate her rights, as these actions were consistent with the legal framework, and the gender reassignment law had not retroactively altered the provisions governing such procedures. Danish civil society organisations have highlighted significant obstacles and delays in the governme't‚Äôs efforts to regularise legal gender recognition processes for minors, despite ongoing attempts to move forward with these reforms.
FRANCE In March, a collective of LGBTI associations filed an appeal with the Council of State to overturn the circulars which govern the procedures for changing first names and the mention of "Äús"x‚Äù on civil status documents. The associations argued that these regulations violate trans pe'ple‚Äôs right to freely define their gender identity.
In November, left-wing parliamentary groups submitted a bill to the National Assembly aimed at simplifying the process to change gender markers on official documents. Currently, applicants are required to present evidence before a judge, such as written testimonies, to prove that their legal gender does not align with their gender identity. The proposed legislation seeks to decentralise this procedure, allowing individuals to make such changes directly at town halls, thereby streamlining the process and enhancing accessibility.
GEORGIA The anti-LGBTI law has reversed any progress towards legal gender recognition. It particularly targets trans people, prohibiting both surgical and legal gender reassignment procedures, effectively denying them the right to change their gender marker on official documents. (See also under Equality and Non-discrimination.) GERMANY In April, the Bundestag passed the Self-Determination Act, allowing trans, intersex, and non-binary people to update their gender marker through a simple declaration at the registry office, based on self-determination. This new law replaces the Transsexual Act (TSG), which had been criticised for being unconstitutional and requiring lengthy, costly, and demeaning court and medical procedures for gender recognition. Self-determination for people without legal status was not included in the legal frame. In May, following the rejection of a motion appealing to the Conciliation Committee, the law was approved also at the Federal Chamber. On November 1st the law came into effect, formalising a process according to which trans, intersex, and nonbinary people aged 18 and older can alter their records by making a personal declaration, with only a three-month waiting period required. Minors over the age of 14 can also change their gender marker with parental approval or legal recourse, while younger children can have their parents act on their behalf, though the child must be present to provide their assent if they are older than five years old HUNGARY This year, 30 applications, representing over 88 clients, were submitted in 2024 before the European Court of Human Rights to reinstate legal gender recognition (LGR) in Hungary.
On June 3, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held a hearing in the Deldits case (C-247/23).The case emerged from a request for preliminary ruling concerning the applicability of Article 16 of the GDPR in procedures for changing the gender marker of refugees. In September, the Advocate General of the CJEU stated that Hungarian immigration authorities must correct the gender marker of a trans person in national registers upon request, if it was incorrectly recorded. The trans man in question requested that his gender marker and name be updated in the national register under Article 16 of the EU GDPR, to reflect his gender identity. In September, the Committee of Ministers issued decisions calling on the Hungarian government to adopt a quick, accessible and transparent procedure for LGR. In October, the Budapest Court suspended the procedure concerning the applicability of Article 16 of the GDPR to correct the gender marker of a trans person of Hungarian nationality until the Deldits case is decided. In November, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Hungary violated Article 8 of the Convention on account of the lack of a regulatory framework on LGR, ensuring the right to respect for the private life of three Hungarian trans persons.
ITALY The municipality of Turin introduced a policy allowing trans and non-binary people to use their chosen name on the GTT public transport card, aligning with their gender identity rather than their registered name. In July, the Constitutional Court, answering the referral of a local court, ruled the request for legal gender recognition of non-binary people inadmissible but has called on Parliament to address the issue legislatively. In July, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the obligation imposed on trans people who want to undergo gender reassignment surgery to ask for authorisation from the court.
Back to index <--> THEMES In August, Augusto Barbera, President of the Constitutional Court, reiterated that parliament should address the legal status of children of same-sex couples and recognise non-binary gender identities.
KAZAKHSTAN The media agency Mediazona reported that trans individuals in Kazakhstan still face significant obstacles in aligning their legal documents with their gender identity. The report indicated that such delays derive from outdated legal and medical practices like mandatory psychiatric evaluations, government approvals, and mandatory sex reassignment surgery. KYRGYZSTAN Since 2021, trans people in Kyrgyzstan have been unable to obtain legal recognition due to amendments made to the Law on Civil Acts. In 2024, the Kyrgyz government further restricted trans rights by adopting new amendments to existing laws, including changes to the Law "ÄúOn the Protection of the Health of Citizens in the Kyrgyz Republi",‚Äù specifically in Article 47, which concerns "he ‚ÄúChange and Correction of Gender Ide"tity.‚Äù Under the new legislation, trans people can no longer undergo medical examination or treatment related to gender transition until the age of 25. Previously, individuals could begin the process at 18. In November, Ky'gyzstan‚Äôs Ministry of Health proposed a draft regulation on the medical examination of trans people. The draft regulation, now open for public discussion, aims to address discrimination against trans and gender-diverse people, ensuring their rights to healthcare and legal gender recognition. The Ministry explained that the regulation is necessary to establish clear and fair procedures, provide access to qualified medical care, and support social integration for trans citizens.
LITHUANIA Following the European Court of Justice'Äôs ruling mandating that EU member states recognise name and gender changes made in other countries within the bloc, the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice announced plans to assess the necessity of updating national legislation. While Lithuania currently acknowledges name changes executed abroad, it does not have an administrative procedure in place for changing gender in civil status records, necessitating a court order instead. Ministry spokesperson Paulius ≈Ωeimys indicated that the department is evaluating how the CJEU decision may influence Lithuanian law moving forward.
MALTA In September, Malta implemented a new law that allows non-binary identities to be officially recognised on birth certificates. The new law builds upon the 2018 Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act that granted trans people the right to update their legal gender by further expanding these rights.
MONTENEGRO The draft law on Legal Gender Recognition based on self-determination was completed by the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights and presented to Parliament in February. The draft law underwent a 30-day public consultation from February 15 to March 15. Despite the Strategy for Improving the Quality of Life of LGBT Persons in Montenegro (2019-2023) urging its adoption by the end of 2023, the law has still not adopted by the end of 2024. The law was been included in Montenegro'Äôs EU Accession Program under chapters 19 and 23, but has faced significant resistance, particularly from the Serbian Orthodox Church and other political forces. The Ministry of Interior has been obstructing the l'w‚Äôs progress. Additionally, other ministries have shown little interest in advancing the law, as well as other legislative reforms to protect the rights of LGBTI people. Despite widespread support from civil society organisations, international bodies like the EU, various embassies, and the Council of Europe, as well as over 100 academics, 137 regional civil society organisations, 18 MEPs, and major European human rights organisations, Prime Minister Spajiƒá and President of the Parliament Andrija Mandiƒá blocked the law by not putting it to a vote.
NETHERLANDS In April, the House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on a motion by the New Social Contract party to withdraw an amendment to the 'ÄòTransgender A't‚Äô, which aims to simplify the process of changing the gender marker in birth certificates. However, just before the debate began, the NSC announced they would temporarily set the motion aside. A few weeks after the initial discussions, a vote was held, and a slight majority voted in favour of asking the government to withdraw the proposed amendment. However, the government ultimately chose not to proceed with the withdrawal, and the newly formed government has maintained the same position. Since the amendment was originally introduced by the government, the decision to withdraw remains at their discretion. In July, the government introduced a bill to remove gender markers from official identification cards, a move long advocated by civil society organisations including the Transgender Network, COC, and NNID.
NORWAY In April, following the submission of a report to the government detailing Norwegian support for the introduction of a third legal Back to index <--> THEMES gender, the Minister of Culture and Equality issued a statement indicating the issue may not be addressed until 2032 due to upcoming changes in the personal identification system.
POLAND In January, the Supreme Court decided to refer a significant case concerning which relatives of trans people should be involved in gender change proceedings to the entire Civil Chamber.¬†In January, the General Prosecutor and Minister of Justice Adam Bodnar withdrew Zbigniew Ziobr'‚Äôs request which started the procedure. However, the Supreme Court has not discontinued the proceedings and has not set a date of seating yet. In February, the 'oE‚Äôs Commissioner for Human Rights highlighted concerns over the lengthy process of gender reassignment court cases.
In March, the government published a draft amendment to the Regulations on the Operation of Common Courts. The amendment was enacted on 1 October. The amendment proposed introducing the possibility for those submitting documentation to request a change of their gender marker to request their case to be classified as urgent to ensure their timely assignment to judges under the Random Case Assignment System and their prioritisation in court scheduling. PORTUGAL In January, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the Assembly of the Republic approved a proposal to allow individuals to choose gender-neutral names. The initiative aimed at eliminating the existing requirement for names to be strictly identified with either male or female genders.
ROMANIA In February, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) heard the case of Case C-4/23 Mirin, involving a Romanian-British trans man who had legally changed his gender marker and name in the UK but faced challenges in having these changes recognised in Romania. In October, the CJEU ruled that Romania, along with all other EU Member States, must recognise and automatically transcribe changes in name and gender marker made through legal gender recognition in another Member State. The court emphasised that this process must occur without the need for additional procedures, ensuring seamless recognition of gender identity across the EU.
The Working Group coordinated by the Romanian Office of the Ombudsperson has taken steps to address the implementation of the X and Y judgment (CJEU cases 2145/16 and 20607/16) and advocate for a legal gender recognition procedure in Romania. Despite these efforts, there has yet to be a legislative initiative.
SLOVAKIA In 2024, the Ministry of Health in Slovakia canceled the guidelines for legal gender reassignment. While the process is still technically allowed under existing laws, registries have stopped performing gender reassignment procedures. Additionally, the Ministry of the Interior has refused to issue an instruction to resume these procedures, causing significant concerns for trans people.
Slovakia mandates trans people to undergo transition-related surgeries and obtain certification from a medical professional to have their gender identity legally recognised. In November 2023, the government reversed guidelines that had previously allowed trans people to update their gender marker on legal documents without the need for surgery.
In May, a proposed amendment to Act No. 301/1995 failed to pass the second reading. The amendment sought to alter the law on birth numbers by mandating that only "Äúbiological s"x‚Äù be recorded on official documents.
SLOVENIA The Ministry of Health officially confirmed its agreement with the Interdisciplinary Council for Gender Recognition, stating that medical treatment is not required for legal gender recognition. As a result, the Ministry has formally requested the Ministry of Internal Affairs to amend the relevant sub-article of the Civil Registry Act.
SPAIN During the recent European Parliament elections, a Spanish content creator was met with resistance and hostility while attempting to vote. The creator reported that the voter registration list displayed his deadname, despite him having previously updated his ID and personal information to reflect his correct name and gender.
In early March, multiple episodes of legal fraud were reported involving military personnel who applied to change their registered sex under Spain'Äôs LGBTI Law, with the aim of mocking trans people and questioning the scope of the law. The concerns arose from distorted reports about the number of individuals in Ceuta who had changed their registered sex following the enactment of the 2023 law for the equality of trans people. Sensationalised media coverage falsely claimed tha" ‚Äúalmost 40 men have become women in Ceuta to take advantage of more lenient selection processes for police or firefighter posit"ons‚Äù or that these individuals, after changing their legal gender, would "njoy ‚Äúbetter retirement benefits and othe" perks.‚Äù In response, FELGTBI+ issued a press release calling on the 'rosecutor‚Äôs Back to index <--> THEMES Office to take decisive action against these fraudulent actions. A collective of trans advocacy groups also denounced the alleged fraud, seeking the help of the Ombudsman of Spain.
SWEDEN In June, Sweden passed a new law on legal gender recognition, which will come into effect on July 1, 2025. Under the law, changing one'Äôs legal gender will no longer require a formal diagnosis. Instead, individuals will be able to apply for a legal gender change with just a certificate from a medical professional. This means that individuals will no longer need to apply to the Judicial Council, which had previously been involved in reviewing these applications, although the Counc'l‚Äôs decisions have been linked to the ongoing public debate around trans issues.
An investigation conducted by magazine Ottar revealed that rejections for legal gender recognition by the Judicial Council have increased, with nearly half of the rejected cases lacking complete medical certificates. Lawyer Silas Aliki, who represents trans people appealing these decisions, suggests that the Council'Äôs decisions have been influenced by the ongoing public debate around trans issues.
At the time of writing, it remains unclear which professions will be authorised to grant these certificates and the specifics of the process are not yet known, aside from the indication that it will be significantly simpler and easier to obtain than a full medical diagnosis.
SWITZERLAND In May, close to 18'Äô000 people supported an open lette" ‚ÄúBreak the code! For the recognition of non-binary pe"ple‚Äù. In July, the Federal Office of Justice invited non-binary people to a meeting to learn about their challenges and demands. Federal Counsellor Beat Jans joined the event after having met with Nemo, a non-binary artist, already in June.
In November, the Federal Court decided on an appeal by the parents of a trans minor who refused to issue the child'Äôs identity documents to the chi'd‚Äôs guardian in order to prevent legal gender recognition. The case involved a couple and their child, who sought to change their gender and first name at the civil registry office in line with Article 30b of the Swiss Civil Code (CC), which allows individuals from the age of 16 who are capable of judgment to make such changes independently.
The parents had challenged their duty to provide the child'Äôs identity documents and by this their chi'd‚Äôs decision, arguing that the assessment of a m'nor‚Äôs capacity should be left to a psychiatrist, not a civil servant. The Court confirmed that as the child is over 16 and capable of judgment, according to Article 30b Civil Code, parental consent is not required for legal gender recognition. The Court stated also that no medical certificate about the capacity of judgment is required unless the civil register officer has doubts and therefore requires such a certificate.
TAJIKISTAN Civil registry offices may also reject the application and insist on considering the request for a gender marker change through the court system, which is not the best option, as there are no laws regulating LGR in Tajikistan that can be used to obtain such a change through the court system. In practice, given that LGR is neither prohibited nor permitted in the country, it is likely that professionals, including doctors, judges, and civil registry office managers, are hesitant to conduct any procedures regarding LGR for fear of the consequences, as well as the unacceptability of transgender people to the state. TURKEY In December, media outlets targeted Samsun Ondokuz Mayƒ±s University over gender reassignment surgeries, labelling them as"‚Äúmur"er‚Äù and calling for a ban. Doctors involved in these surgeries were criticised by the same media outlets. TURKMENISTAN Turkmenistan has no legally approved procedure for medical or legal transition for trans people.
UKRAINE An assessment by ECOM on the Needs of Trans People in Ukraine highlighted worsening challenges due to the war, including financial barriers to accessing hormones, medical care, housing, and employment, further exacerbated by discrimination. The report noted that the need for financial aid has shifted from food to essentials like warm clothing and power alternatives, while access to healthcare, including gender-related care and mental health services, has deteriorated.
Trans people have reported that doctors have largely ceased diagnosing conditions such as "Äúgender dysphori".‚Äù Many medical professionals are wary of potential scrutiny from law enforcement, who might view these diagnoses as aiding conscription evasion. Furthermore, according to Insight Ukraine the diagnostic process is frequently delayed and made more complex and there have been cases where medical professionals have demanded bribes in exchange for providing the necessary diagnosis. As a result, the formal process for gender transition for trans people in Ukraine has been effectively on hold.
UNITED KINGDOM Back to index <--> THEMES The photo ID requirement for voting underscored difficulties for trans people registering to vote, as many lack a gender recognition certificate due to its cost and complex process.
In May, Scotland'Äôs Prime Minister John Swinney admitted that the bill aimed at simplifying gender changes without requiring a medical diagnosis, passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2022, could not be implemented while it was blocked by the previous Conservative UK Government.
In June, the Conservatives had vowed to amend the 2010 Equality Act to define "Äús"x‚Äù strictly as biological sex assigned at birth in case of victory in the general elections. The new Labour UK Government has no such plans.
In November, Scottish Secretary Ian Murray faced criticism for refusing to lift a Tory-imposed veto on the Gender Recognition Reform Bill, despite the bill having the support of Scottish Labour. The bill, which passed in December 2022 with backing from all parties in the Scottish Parliament, sought to simplify the gender recognition process for trans people by allowing self-determination. However, then-Scottish Secretary Alister Jack used a Section 35 order to block the legislation, a power under the 1998 Scotland Act. Murray, who became Scottish Secretary in July, sided with the Tories, stating that while he didn'Äôt believe the use of the Section 35 order was correct, Labour would not revoke it. UZBEKISTAN In Uzbekistan, homosexuality is criminalised, with penalties of up to three years in prison. However, the law does not recognise trans identities, leading to further mistreatment as trans people are often misclassified and persecuted as gay men.
