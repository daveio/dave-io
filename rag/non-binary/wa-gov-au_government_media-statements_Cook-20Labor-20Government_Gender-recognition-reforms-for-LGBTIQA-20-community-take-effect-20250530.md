# Gender recognition reforms for LGBTIQA+ community take effect

A streamlined process
for sex or gender recognition for trans and gender-diverse Western Australians
under new laws began operating today (30 May).

Individuals can now
apply directly to the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages to update their
sex or gender on their birth registration record.

The commencement of
the _Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Amendment (Sex or Gender
Changes) Act 2024_ means people are no longer required to undergo a
reassignment procedure to formally change their sex or gender.

Evidence required
to support an application is now a statement from a doctor or a psychologist
which certifies that a person has received appropriate clinical treatment in
relation to their sex or gender.

The new legislation
also abolishes the Gender Reassignment Board, which previously issued
recognition certificates, and repeals the _Gender Reassignment Act 2000_,
to bring WA into line with other States and Territories.

Significant work
across government to prepare for the implementation of the new laws included
consultation with LGBTIQA+ advocacy groups and professional medical bodies to
develop guidance material for the reforms.

The Law Reform
Commission of Western Australia (LRCWA) recommended the reforms in its 2018 review
of the legislation.

Consistent with the
LRCWA's recommendations and other jurisdictions, the sex or gender descriptor
of 'non-binary' is now available for Western Australians, in addition to 'male'
and 'female'.

Stricter rules
apply for people under the age of 18, including parental consent or permission
from the Family Court of Western Australia in certain circumstances.

Information about
the new process for applicants and doctors and psychologists is available on
the [RBDM
website](https://www.wa.gov.au/service/justice/civil-law/change-of-sex-or-gender).

The reforms do not
change the existing procedures that relate to the registration of sex when a
child is born.

The Act also
contains a statutory review clause, ensuring the community can provide feedback
on the operation and effectiveness of the regime.

**Comments attributed to Attorney General Dr Tony Buti:**

"The State Government
introduced these reforms to adopt a more respectful and inclusive approach to
gender diversity and ensure equality for all Western Australians.

"We were able to remove
outdated barriers that denied people identity documents that aligned with their
lived identity.

"The changes mean
applicants will no longer need to undergo a surgery, or other reassignment
procedures, to change their sex or gender on their birth record.

"The government consulted
widely with stakeholders to achieve what is a significant step in support of
diversity and inclusion in our State.

"I thank all stakeholders
for their valued and meaningful engagement with government on the
implementation of the reforms."
