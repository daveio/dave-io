# The Third Gender and Hijras

### Hinduism Case Study - Gender | 2018

While recognition of genders outside male and female has only recently been discussed in Western societies, in Hindu society, people of non-binary gender expression have played important roles for over 2000 years.

## Note on This Case Study

When considering this case study, remember that every major world religion originated and has grown in patriarchal societiesâ€”that is, societies where men hold most of the cultu'eâ€™s power, and people of any other gender are largely excluded from power.Â  In this patriarchal context, religions have responded in very different ways, sometimes upholding and supporting misogyny, and sometimes subverting and rejecting it in favor of gender equality.Â  Powerful women, feminists, and members of the LGBTQ community have played major roles in all faith traditions, in diverse ways across different times and cultures.

As always, when thinking about religion and gender, maintain a focus on how religion is internally diverse, always evolving and changing, and embedded in specific cultures.

Called the third gender, evidence for their existence in Hindu society can be found in Hindu holy texts like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, where Hindu hero Arjuna becomes the third gender.Â  Third gender people have often been revered throughout South Asian history; for example, Muslim rulers of the Mughal Empire in the 15th to 19th centuries were generous patrons of third gender Indians. Â  Many rose to significant positions of power under both Hindu and Muslim rulers. Â  In 2014, it was estimated that around 3 million third gender people live in India alone.

While the third gender includes a few different groups in South Asia, the most common are the hijras.Â  Hijras are often born male but look and dress in traditionally feminine ways.Â  Many, but not all, choose to undergo a castration ceremony, removing their male genitalia as an offering to Hindu goddess Bahuchara Mata.Â  Other hijras are born intersex.Â  Often called transgender by outsiders, Indian society and most hijras consider themselves to be third genderâ€”neither male nor female, not transitioning.Â  They are a different gender altogether. Â  However, hijra identity is complex, and recently, some have identified as transgender and sought gender reassignment procedures.

Regardless, most hijras'€™ defining characteristic is leaving home to become a part of the hijra community, a community which removes itself from wider society and teaches its lessons in secret.Â  A young person is initiated by following a guru, or teacher, who will teach the chela, or disciple, in the hijra ways of life.Â  This includes leaving their home to live in community with other hijras, to learn the ritual roles that they perform in Hindu households. Â  Hijra are expected to perform dances, songs, and blessings at both births and weddings of Hindus.Â  To many Hindus, a'hijraâ€™s blessings of a baby will confer fertility, prosperity, and long life on the child.Â  One to two days after a marriage ceremonyâ€”hijras will perform to bless the couple for fertility.Â  To many Hindus, it is the third gender nature of hijrasâ€”including their sacrifice of their procreative ability to the goddessâ€”that grants hijras this incredible religious power.Â  In fact, hijras also can curse a family if they are disrespectful or refuse to pay for the blessings.Â  Many Hindus, and the hijras themselves, take these blessings and curses very seriously; hijras say they only curse in extreme circumstances.Â  While hijras are often invited to perform these rituals, they will also attend births and marriages unannounced, claiming their right to attend as their sacred religious duty.Â  Fearful of receiving a curse from hijras, Hindu families often welcome them in and pay them for their services, even when uninvited.Â  However, sometimes Hindu families refuse them entry or refuse to pay, even going as far as calling the police.Â  Still, the cultural authority of the hijra is so powerful, that the police will often do nothing to remove them. Â  Hijras are often treated with both respect and fear.

Historically and culturally hijras are based in Hinduism and they perform solely for Hindus.Â  However, hijras are not all Hindu themselves.Â  Many are Muslim and a few are Christian.Â  In fact, some hijras follow the beliefs and practices of both Hinduism and Islam.Â  For example, some hijras center their community around the Hindu goddess Bahuchara Mata while also taking a Muslim name and observing Islamic traditions such as Ramadan. Â  Just as hijra are not limited by binary views of gender, some are not limited by a single religious tradition.

While hijras have been treated with both fear and respect for thousands of years, much of this respect did not survive Hinduism'€™s encounter with colonialism.Â  The British colonized most of South Asia in the 19th and 20th centuries, and were shocked by third gender people.Â  Based in Christian beliefs about gender at the time, the British named all hijras criminals in 1871, and instructed colonial authorities to arrest them on sight.Â  However, because of their important religious functions for Hindus, hijras persisted without significant interruption. Still, nearly 200 years of stigmatization by the British eventually took a toll.Â  While hijras have maintained their traditional rights and responsibilities at births and marriages and the 1871 law was repealed shortly after independence, today, hijra are often treated with contempt.Â  They are almost always excluded from employment and education outside of their ritual roles.Â  As a result, they are often stricken by poverty and forced to resort to begging and prostitution to survive.Â  They are often victims of violence and abuse, harassed by police and refused treatment at hospitals.

Recently, hijra have regained some of the rights and freedoms which they have been denied.Â  By 2014, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh had all officially recognized third gender people as citizens deserving of equal rights.Â  The Supreme Court of India stated" â€œit is the right of every human being to choose their gen"er,â€ and that recognition of the g"oup, â€œis not a social or medical issue, but a human right" issue.â€Â  They directed the government to open education and job opportunities to all third gender groups.Â  While progress has been slow, in 2015 the first hijra mayor in India was elected in the city of Raigarh, and in 2017 the city of Kochi hired 23 hijra to work for their public transit system. Â  Still progress is slow, and most third gender people remain in poverty, even as they continue to bless Hindu families with prosperity.
