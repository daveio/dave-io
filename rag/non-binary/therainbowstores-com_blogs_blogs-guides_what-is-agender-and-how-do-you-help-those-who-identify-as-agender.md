# What Is Agender

![agender meaning blog image]()

## Agender Meaning

When somebody is agender it means they don'Äôt identify as male or female, or with any other gender identity. They may feel a sense of disconnection from the traditional binary gender system and may choose to express themselves in ways that are not associated with any particular gender.

It'Äôs important to understand that being agender is not the same as being genderless. While agender individuals do not identify with any particular gender, they still have a gender identity that is a part of who they are.

Like all gender identities, being agender is a deeply personal and individual experience. Each agender person'Äôs experience may be different, and 't‚Äôs important to respect their identity and pronoun preferences' It‚Äôs also important to recognize that agender individuals may face unique challenges in a world that is often built around a binary gender system.

## Agender Pronouns

There are several options for agender people in terms of pronouns, so it'Äôs always best to ask first. This is why normalising stating your pronouns when you meet someone allows everyone to calmly give their preference without it feeling uncomfortable.

Agender individuals may use gender-neutral pronouns such as "Äúthey/them/the"r‚Äù"or ‚Äú"e/hir‚Äù and use gender neutral prefix such as Mx.

In some cases they may prefer to be referred to by just using their name. So for example: 'ÄòEmily will be talking to you about feedback from Emi'y‚Äôs last semi'ar.‚Äô

Some agender people may wish to use more than one set of pronouns to refer to themselves. So they might feel equally comfortable with they/them, he/him or she/her. You'Äôll often see people state their pronouns as she/they or he/they.

If someone uses a combination of pronouns, you can ask them which they prefer you to use. Their preference may be for you to use all of them interchangeably, or keep to one set. Remember that this may be because they'Äôre using different pronouns at work, at home and with friends.

### What It Feels Like To Be Agender

We asked an agender friend to write a few words on how it feels to be agender, so gendered people might understand.

"ÄúAs an agender person, my experience is characterised by a lack of gender identity or a disconnect from the traditional binary gender system. This means that I d'n‚Äôt identify as male or female, nor do I feel a strong attachment to any other gender identity.

"ÄúBeing agender can be difficult to explain to others because gender is such a deeply ingrained part of our society, but 't‚Äôs important to remember tha' it‚Äôs a valid and real experience.

"ÄúOne of the most challenging aspects of being agender is navigating a world that is built around a binary gender system. From public toilets to forms that only have options for"¬†‚Ä"male"Äù or ‚"úfe'ale,‚Äù it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating to constantly face situations wh're you 'eel ‚Äòothered'Äô, like you don‚Äôt quite fit in. Even seemingly innocuous things like gendered language or clothing can feel alie'ating when you don‚Äôt identify with the gender norms they represent.

"ÄúAnother challenge of being agender is dealing with the assumptions and expectations of others. People often assume that everyone has a gender identity and that 't‚Äôs a fundamental part of who we are. This can lead to confusion, disbelief, or even hostility when you explain that you'don‚Äôt feel that way. Some people may try to insist that you must have a gender or th't you‚Äô"e just ‚Ä"confused,‚Äù while others may simply be unable to underst'nd what you‚Äôre talking about.

"ÄúDespite these challenges, being agender can also be liberating in many ways. Without the constraints of gender norms and expectations, there is a sense of freedom and flexibility in how you can express yourself.

"You'Äôre not limited by the stereotypes and roles that are often associated with gender, and y'u‚Äôre free to explore your own identity and interests without feeling like you have to conform to any particular gender identity.

"ÄúUltimately, being agender is just one part of who I am, and it doe'n‚Äôt define me completely' It‚Äôs a unique experience that comes with its own challenges and rewards, 'ut it‚Äôs also something that is still not widely understood or accepted in our society.

"Äú't‚Äôs important for people to remember that gender identity is a personal and individual experience, and that we should all be free to express ourselves in the ways that feel most authentic and true to who we"are‚Äù.

## Agender Pride Day

Agender Pride Day is an annual event celebrated by members of the agender community to raise awareness and celebrate the identity of those who identify as agender. The day is typically marked on July 14th, and is a time for agender individuals to come together and celebrate their identity.

The event is an opportunity for agender individuals to share their experiences and celebrate their identity, as well as raise awareness about the agender community and the unique challenges they face. It'Äôs also a chance to promote acceptance and understanding of the agender identity, and to educate others about the spectrum of gender identities that exist.

Agender Pride Day is a reminder that everyone'Äôs experience of gender is valid, and that there is no on" ‚Äúr"ght‚Äù way to identi'y. It‚Äôs a day to celebrate diversity and promote inclusivity, and to work towards creating a world where all individuals can express themselves freely and authentically.

Being agender is a valid and real experience, and it'Äôs important to support and celebrate individuals who identify as agender. By promoting acceptance and understanding of all gender identities, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse society.

## Agender Flag

The Agender Pride Flag was first seen in 2014 and was created by New York artist Salem in order to increase agender visibility. The black and white stripes represent the absence of gender, the grey represents semi-genderlessness and green represents non-binary genders. Green was chosen because it'Äôs outside the spectrum of blue-pink which is seen as the gendered spectrum.

### Agender Symbol

The most used symbol to represent agender people is a simple circle with a diagonal line through it from top right to bottom left. Although an alternative symbol includes the traditional symbols for male, female and trans and a strikethrough across the central circle. The strikethrough can go horizontally or at a 45 degree angle. There is a further symbol with a single arm extending vertically. But this represents someone who identifies as genderless.

### How to Support Agender People

As agender identities are so poorly understood there are many who may intentionally or mistakenly devalue or erase anyone who identifies as agender. So it'Äôs critical to support anyone who identifies as agender by creating a safe and inclusive environment that respects their identity. Here are some ways you can support someone who is agender:

By being supportive and inclusive, you can help create a more accepting and affirming world for agender individuals.

### Comparisons With Other Gender Terms

### Is Agender the same as Trans or Transgender?

No. The meaning of transgender has morphed slightly over time. While it has always meant 'Äòpeople who do not identify as the gender they were assigned at bir'h‚Äô, it had traditionally been seen to mean they identified as the opposite binary. But that has evolved to become more of an umbrella term to include anyone who identifies as any other gender than the one they were assigned at birth. So while all agender people are officially trans, not all will identify as trans because of the historical associations trans has with binary genders.

### Is Agender the same as Gender Non-conforming?

No. Gender nonconforming is a much wider and more general term to mean anyone who does not conform to the gender norms that are expected of them. So while it could be said that all agender people are gender non-conforming, it'Äôs probably easier to say that there are overlaps. Certainly not all gender non-conforming people are agender.

### Is Agender the same as Non-binary?

No, but agender does sit under n0n-binary.. The Non-binary identity is an umbrella term that includes those genders that do not fit the exclusively male or female binary categories. So while it'Äôs true that agender sits within the non-binary identity, there are many non-binary people who do not identify as agender.

### Is Agender the same as Genderqueer?

No. Although genderqueer is a difficult identity to explain accurately. While it has similarities to non-binary there are subtle differences, as it has been defined by so many people over time that it has come to mean different things.

Some see it as a more of a political statement, in the same way that some identify as queer rather than gay, lesbian or bisexual. Essentially it refers to "Äúa person who does not subscribe to conventional gender distinctions but identifies with neither, both, or a combination of male and female gende"s‚Äù.

It's important to understand that gender identity is relative to each individual and how they identify. And every genderqueer person has a different definition of what that means to them.

### Is Agender the same as Apagender?

No. Apagender means that a person is apathetic about which gender people think they are and does not feel strongly about what pronouns other people use to refer to them.
