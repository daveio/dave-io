Although contemporary culture likes to position gender non-conforming people as a new phenomenon, history shows otherwise. Anthropologists have long documented cultures around the world that acknowledge more than two genders. There are examples going back 3,000 years to the [Iron Age](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-ancient-civilization-in-iran-recognized-transgender-people-study-suggests-1.6790205), and even further back to the [Copper Age](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/04/06/5000-year-old-transgender-skeleton-discovered/). In this article, we'Äôll explore cultures from around the world in which the boundaries between male and female gender expressions have been fluid ‚Äî and celebrated for being so.

### Pacific Islands

Long before Cook'Äôs arrival in Hawaii, a multiple-gender tradition existed among the Kanaka Maoli indigenous society. The _mahu_ referred to biological males or females who inhabited a gender role somewhere between, or encompassing both, the masculine and feminine. They held a sacred social role as educators and promulgators of ancient traditions and rituals.

_Fa'Äôafafine_ are people who identify themselves as a third-gender in Samoa, American Samoa and the Samoan diaspora. A recognized gender identity/gender role since at least the early 20th century in Samoan society ‚Äî and some theorize an integral part of traditional Samoan culture ‚'î _fa‚Äôafafine_ are male at birth and explicitly embody both masculine and feminine gender traits, fashioned in a way unique to this part of the world.

### Africa

Prior to colonization, the Ankole people in what is now Uganda elected a woman to dress as a man and thereby become an oracle to the god Mukasa.

Among the Sakalavas of Madagaskar, little boys thought to have a feminine appearance were raised as girls. The Antandroy and Hova called their gender-crossers _sekrata._ They, like the society'Äôs women, wore their hair long and in decorative knots, inserted silver coins in pierced ears and adorned their arms, wrists and ankles with many bracelets.

### Latin America

In pre-colonial Andean culture, the Incas worshipped the _chuqui chinchay_, a dual-gendered god. Third-gender ritual attendants or shamans performed sacred rituals to honor this god. The _quariwarmi_ shamans wore androgynous clothing as "Äúa visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dea".‚Äù

Today, the indigenous Zapotec culture of Oaxaca is not divided by the usual dichotomies: gay or straight, male or female. There'Äôs a commonly accepted third category of mixed gender ‚Äî people called _muxes_. (Their name is said to derive from _mujer_ ‚Äî the Spanish wor" for ‚"úwoman.‚Äù) Some are men who live as women; others identify beyond a single gender.

### Asia

Indonesia recognizes a third gender, _waria_. One ethnic group, the Bugis (numbering around 3 million people) recognize five genders. Their language offers five terms referencing various combinations of sex, gender and sexuality: _makkunrai_ ("Äúfemale wom"n‚Äù), _oroan"_ (‚Äúma"e men‚Äù), _ca"alai_ (‚Äú"emale men‚Äù),"_calabai_ "‚Äúmale women‚Ä") and _bissu_ (‚Äút"ansgender priests‚Äù). These definitions are not exact, but suffice.

In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the _hijras_ are officially recognized as third gender by the government, being neither completely male nor female. In India also, transgender people have been given the status of "Äúthird gend"r‚Äù and are protected by law, despite the social ostracism. The term more commonly advocated by social workers and transgender community members themselves is _khwaja sira._ This can identify the individual as a transsexual person, transgender person (_khusras_), cross-dresser (_zenanas_) or eunuch (_narnbans_).

_Kathoey_ or _katoey_ refers to either a transgender woman or effeminate gay male in Thailand. A significant number of Thais perceive _kathoeys_ as belonging to a third gender ‚Äî including many _kathoeys_ themselves ‚Äî while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman. However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as _phuyin"_ (‚Ä"women‚Äù), with a minority referring to themselves as _phuying praphet s"ng_ (a ‚Äúsecond kin" of woman‚Äù) and only very few referring to themselves as _kathoey_.

### Native America

Anthropological research indicates well over 100 instances of diverse gender expression in Native American tribes at the time of early European contact. The most common modern term for gender non-conforming members is "ÄúTwo Spir"t‚Äù (also two-spirit or twospirit) used by some indigenous North Americans to describe certain spiritual people ‚Äî gay, lesbian, bisexual and gender-variant individuals ‚Äî in their communities. The term was adopted in 1990 at an Indigenous lesbian and gay international gathering to encourage the replacement of the anthropological term _berdache_.

"ÄúTwo Spir"t‚Äù is not interchangeable w"th ‚ÄúLGBT Native Ame"ican.‚Äù This title differs from most Western, mainstream, definitions of sexuality and gender identity in that it is not so much about with whom one sleeps or how one personally identifies; rather, it is a sacred, spiritual and ceremonial role that is recognized and confirmed by the Elders of the Tw' Spirit‚Äôs ceremonial community. While some have found the term a useful tool for intertribal organizing, not all Native cultures conceptualize gender or sexuality this way, and most tribes use names in their own languages. While some terms are not always appropriate or"welcome, ‚"úTwo Spirit‚Äù has generally received more acceptance and use than the term it replaced.

Individual tribes often also have their own classifications, such as the _w√≠≈ãkte_ among the Lakota, the _mixuga_ among the Ponca, the _bad√©_ among the Crow and many others. These are all third-gender roles adopted by males, somewhat analogous to what we might think of as a transgender woman today. T'ey‚Äôre not exactly equivalent of course. In general, these third-gender roles were liminal social positions, standing somewhere between the categories of man and woman ‚Äî being neither, but having traits of both in addition to traits unique unto themselves.

The degree to which a third-gender person could shift fluidly between man, woman and third gender roles varied among cultures. Osh-Tisch, the most famous _bad√©_, for example, generally adopted the attire of women and engaged in wome'‚Äôs work, but when war came to the Crow, Osh-Tisch adopted 'en‚Äôs clothing and fought with the men (earning the rather badass name Finds-Them-and-Kills-Them). Among the Crow of that time (late 1800s), Osh-'isch‚Äôs gender fluidity was considered less remarkable than the fact that a woman, The Other Magpie, also fought alongside Osh-Tisch. Like most _bad√©_, Osh-Tisch never married, but did have at least one long-term relationship with a man and perhaps another with a woman (who may be The Other Magpie). When the U.S. forced their own ideas of gender on the Crow, the people rallied in defense of the _bad√©_. Though Osh-Tisch was eventually forced by US agents to adopt what they deemed appropriate attire and labor for a man, the _bad√©_ managed to keep many of the traditions associated with that gender role alive.

Din√© (Navajo) society has traditionally had five genders: _asdzaan_ (female-in-woman), _hastiin_ (male-in-man), _nadleeh_ (hermaphrodite, androgyny or gender fluidity), _nadleehi_ (woman-in-man, feminine gender) and _dilbah_ (man-in-woman, masculine gender).

For the Navajo, gender had less to do with sexual preference or biology than societal role. Most of the time, there was not much special about these people. Social hierarchy meant that female-gendered individuals were more powerful because the feminine is the first gender. _Nadleeh_ could be revered because they might express both male and female spirits perfectly, whereas every other gender could express only one spirit. (It is worth noting though that not every _nadleeh_ does, which is why sometimes people say that the Navajo have "Äúat lea"t‚Äù five genders ‚Äî there is some wiggle room in there).

### ‚Ä¶ and beyond

Even in the heart of Catholic Italy, in Naples, there is a centuries-old phenomenon of _femminielli_, those assigned male at birth who dress and behave as women. They are respected figures and traditionally believed to bring good luck; a cultural tradition that may date back to pagan rituals of crossdressing, or eunuch priests.

This vast anthropological and archaeological evidence of multiple gender expression is often willfully ignored, but the reality is that gender non-conformity has been a part of human society since the very beginning. And, it'Äôs not going anywhere.

### About the Gender Pronoun Education/Awareness Initiative

Promoting diversity and inclusion is a key component of our healthy and productive workplace culture. The newest effort to nurture this culture is the UCOP Gender Pronoun Education/Awareness Initiative, which is focused on educating staff around how we can support trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming staff by implementing simple changes in how we use pronouns in the workplace.

This is the third article in a three-part series, which includes "Äú[Introducing the Gender Pronoun Initiative](http://link.ucop.edu/2019/09/23/introducing-the-gender-pronoun-initiative")‚Äù (Sept. 23) "nd ‚Äú[What is gender?](http://link.ucop.edu/2019/10/07/gender-pronoun-initiative-what-is-ge"der/)‚Äù (Oct. 7). Stay tuned for our next article on Oct. 22.
