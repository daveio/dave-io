# Agender

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Agender_Flag.png/250px-Agender_Flag.png)

**Agender** describes a person with no [gender identity](/wiki/Gender_identity "Gender identity"). This means the person feels like neither a man nor a woman.[[1]](#cite_note-1) (The [prefix](/wiki/Prefix "Prefix") "a-" means 'no' or 'none,' so "a-[gender](/wiki/Gender "Gender")" means 'no gender'.) They might identify as a [non-binary](/wiki/Non-binary_gender "Non-binary gender") gender, or they might feel they belong to no gender at all.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

Agender people are sometimes called "genderless", "[genderqueer](/wiki/Genderqueer "Genderqueer")", or "ungendered". Some agender people may also identify themselves as [transgender](/wiki/Transgender "Transgender"). Others do not, because they feel "transgender" implies that they identify as a specific gender.

## Diversity

Agender people are diverse in many ways. They do not all have the same [sexuality](/wiki/Human_sexuality "Human sexuality"), use the same [pronouns](/wiki/Pronoun "Pronoun"), or feel the same about their bodies.

Some agender people experience [gender dysphoria](/wiki/Gender_dysphoria "Gender dysphoria") if they are unable to express their identity comfortably. Some wish to change their bodies to feel more comfortable, while others do not.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

Different agender people use different pronouns. Many use "[they](/wiki/They "They")/them". However, others prefer unique pronouns called [neopronouns](/wiki/Neopronoun "Neopronoun") (like "xe/xer" or "ze/zem"). Some use conventional pronouns (such as [he](/wiki/He "He")/him or [she](/wiki/She "She")/her) or uncommon pronouns (such as [one](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_(pronoun)> "en:One (pronoun)")/one's or [it](</wiki/It_(pronoun)> "It (pronoun)")/its).

Gender is not the same as sexuality - so being agender is not the same as being [asexual](/wiki/Asexuality "Asexuality"). An agender person might be asexual, but they might also identify as any other sexuality.
