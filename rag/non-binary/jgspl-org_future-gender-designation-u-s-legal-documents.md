Recently, California became the first U.S. state to add a non-binary gender option into state law, enabling residents to have non-binary listed as their gender on official documents such as birth certificates, driver'€™s licenses, and state-issued identification.[[1]](#\_ftn1)Â  California Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 179, the Gender Recognition Act, on October 15, 2017.[[2]](#\_ftn2)Â  The Act is intended to ensure that intersex, transgender, and non-binary people have full legal recognition of their accurate gender identity.[[3]](#\_ftn3)Â  The signing of the Act prompts speculation about the future of gender designation on US federal documents, and whether having gender non-binary identification makes people a target for harassment.

Though this is a landmark bill, it is not the first time a U.S. state recognized non-binary as a gender option.[[4]](#\_ftn4)Â  In 2016, an OregonÂ judge granted Jamie Shu'eâ€™s petition to legally change their existing gender marker from female to non-binary.[[5]](#\_ftn5)Â  Oregon then became the first U.S. state to announce that it would allo' 'n â€˜Xâ€™ gender option on state-issued identifications beginning in July 2017.[[6]](#\_ftn6)Â  Soon af'er Oregonâ€™s announcement, Washington, DC issued the first U.S. gender-ne'tral driverâ€™s licenses in June 2017.[[7]](#\_ftn7)

California'€™s Gender Recognition Act will end the requirement for Californians to demonstrate that they have undergone treatment before changing the gender on their legal documents.[[8]](#\_ftn8) Â It also provides that the State Registrar shall issue new birth certificates reflecting a requested gender change to individuals without a court order, so long as the person applies and submits an affidavit.[[9]](#\_ftn9)Â  The affidavit would require applicants to att"st â€œunder penalty of perjury that the request for a change of gender to (female, male, non-binary) is to conform the 'ersonâ€™s legal gender to th' personâ€™s gender identity and is not made for any fraudulen" purpose.â€[[10]](#\_ftn10)

Other countries, including the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Nepal, have also begun introducing non-binary options on legal documents, often using '€'Xâ€™ as the designation.[[11]](#\_ftn11) In August, Canada began interim measures for non-binary individuals to note that their passports should be identified'a' â€˜Xâ€™ until Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is able to begin printing documents 'i'h an â€˜Xâ€™.[[12]](#\_ftn12)Â  The Minister of IRCC, The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, stated that by introdu'i'g the new â€˜Xâ€™ designa"ion, Canada was â€œtaking an important step towards advancing equality for all Canadians regardless of gender iden"ity or expression.â€[[13]](#\_ftn13)

While many consider the introduction of non-binary or gender-unspecified legal documents a human rights breakthrough, the new designation could make the document-bearer a target for harassment.[[14]](#\_ftn14)Â  Australi'â€™s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website cautions passport holders with t'e'â€˜Xâ€™ designation about potential problems while travelling internationally.[[15]](#\_ftn15)Â  The website warns that people travelling with a passport 'h'wing â€˜Xâ€™ may encounter difficulties with crossing international borders, and that Australia cannot guarant"e'that the â€œXâ€™ passport will be accepted for entry or transit by another country.[[16]](#\_ftn16)Â  Some non-binary individuals argue that having a legal 'o'ument with an â€˜Xâ€™ designation will be helpful because it will prompt a discussion about their gender identity, r't'er t'a' having an â€˜Fâ€™ or â€˜Mâ€™ that does not match their physical appearance and identity.[[17]](#\_ftn17)

U.S. passports do not currently allow for a non-binary or gender-neutral option.[[18]](#\_ftn18)Â  The U.S. Department of State website states that"â€œthe only genders available for a passport are male and fem"leâ€ in response to a frequently asked question about gender identity.[[19]](#\_ftn19)Â  In 2015, Lambda Legal filed a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department, asserting that they violated the due process and equal protection components of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution be denying a citizen a passport that accurately reflects their gender.[[20]](#\_ftn20)Â  The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado ruled in their favor in 2016.[[21]](#\_ftn21)Â  The case was reopened in June 2017 because the Department of State has not yet recognized a gender marker aside from male or female.[[22]](#\_ftn22)

With the signing of California'€™s Gender Recognition Act and multiple U.S. states beginning to issue non-binary legal identification, a more public discussion of gender designation on federal documents is inevitable. [[23]](#\_ftn23)
