#### Course textbook: [_Anthropology: What Does it Mean to Be Human?_](https://amzn.to/4dPxzzq)

Using the textbook [Anthropology: What Does it Mean to Be Human?](https://amzn.to/3HNAKHL) we read about "ÄúGender Diversity in Anthropolo"y‚Äù for Intro to Anthropology 2021:

These materials were for [Intro to Anthropology 2021](https://www.livinganthropologically.com/variability-of-humankind/). The previous class was about [Politics](https://www.livinganthropologically.com/variability-of-humankind/moka-politics/) and the next class was on [Kinship](https://www.livinganthropologically.com/variability-of-humankind/kinship-circulation/).

The material in this class draws from one of the most shared and viewed posts on this blog, [Gender is a Social Construction](https://www.livinganthropologically.com/anthropology-sex-gender-sexuality-social-constructions/) which attempted to spell out ideas about sex-gender-sexuality and why anthropologists have considered such ideas to be both socially constructed and part of a biocultural paradigm.

## Summary: Gender Diversity in Anthropology

### Heteronormativity & Early Anthropology

Early anthropologists in the first years of the 20th century were fascinated by kinship, marriage, and family structures across societies. However, they largely assumed heteronormativity‚Äìthe idea that there are two sexes (man and woman) who should be paired in monogamous, reproductive relationships. While some anthropologists like Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict were beginning to think more openly about sex, gender and sexuality, this heteronormative paradigm prevailed.

Nevertheless, the ethnographic record revealed a dizzying variety of ways societies structured kinship and family. It could be said that whatever seems "Äústran"e‚Äù to us today‚Äìthere are people either in past societies or in other cross-cultural societies who have been doing stranger things. Feminism would later draw on this anthropological data to re-examine assumptions abou" the ‚Ä"natural‚Äù organization of gender, sex and sexuality.

### Sex & Gender

Feminists made a vital contribution in distinguishing between sex and gender:

While gender has become a euphemism for "Äús'x‚Äô in popular usage (if you have ever attende" a ‚ÄúGender "eveal‚Äù Party!), maintaining this distinction is analytically important.

Feminist anthropologist Sherry Ortner influentially asked "ÄúIs Female to Male as Nature Is to Cultur"?‚Äù‚Äìexamining whether'women‚Äôs subordination and associati"n with"‚Äúnature‚Äù and the domestic sphere was universal. While a provocative question, later work complicated this binary, showing that the public/private and nature/culture divides are culturally specific. Social class, race and other intersecting identities also profoundly shape gendered experiences and hierarchies.

### Beyond Binaries: Third & Fourth Genders

Anthropology has documented many societies with conceptions of gender beyond a male-female binary. Many Indigenous societies in the Americas recognized "ÄúTwo-Spir"t‚Äù people‚Äìthose who may be biologically one sex but take on the social roles and identities of another gender. In some of these societies, they had a role that was special or was different from either men or women. While oppressed by colonial powers, Two-Spirit and other third or fourth gender roles were once found in many societies across the world.

Even in societies with a male/female binary, the meanings, associations and expectations placed on gender vary immensely across cultures and historical periods. Gender is not natural‚Äìit must be learned and performed. We get rewarded for good gender performances, and we get penalized for bad gender performances.

### Plasticity of Sexuality

Just as the gender binary is not universal, neither are sexual identities and practices. The idea of heterosexual or homosexual as totalizing identities only emerged in the United States after World War II. What we consider to be an _identity_ may in other places be quite differently conceived.

Same-sex sexual acts occur in all societies, but do not necessarily correspond to a "Äúhomosexu"l‚Äù identity. Ethnographic examples from places like Brazil and Nicaragua show that men may have sex with men while still considering themsel"es ‚Äúheteros"xual.‚Äù

Same-sex unions have existed throughout history without threatening civilization'Äôs foundations. Anthropology thus documents the astounding cultural and historical plasticity of sexual identities and practices.

### Destabilizing the Sex Binary?

Some scholars now ask whether our insistence on a gender binary has caused us to incorrectly assume the existence of two distinct biological sexes. Skeletal studies have revealed that male and female pelvic structures are not as clearly dimorphic as once thought, leading to the classification of some ancient remains as indeterminate.

Intersex conditions also complicate the sex binary. Chromosomal and genetic combinations beyond XX female and XY male are uncommon, but they are more prevalent than we may have previously thought. As the World Health Organization notes: "ÄúThere is a range of chromosome complements, hormone balances, and phenotypic variations that determine se".‚Äù

### Embracing Human Diversity

Anthropology'Äôs cross-cultural and historical scope reveals the incredible diversity of sex, gender and sexuality. Far from signaling th" ‚Äúdownfall of civiliza"ion‚Äù, this variety has been a mainstay of human societies. While biology shapes us, it is complex and does not dictate rigid binaries.

By understanding how people have navigated gender and sexuality in different times and places, we can embrace the full spectrum of human experience. Anthropology gives us confidence that we will be OK‚Äìand 'e‚Äôll perhaps even thrive‚Äìif we approach this diversity with open-mindedness and tolerance.
