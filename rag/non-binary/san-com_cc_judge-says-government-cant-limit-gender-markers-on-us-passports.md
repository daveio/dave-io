## Summary

### Passport policy

A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from enforcing its passport policy on transgender and non-binary Americans. The ruling means people can change their name or sex designation to match the gender they identify with.

### Trump'Äôs policy

In January, President Trump signed an executive order saying people can only be male or female, rejecting the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender.

### Expanded impact

The judge'Äôs ruling Tuesday granted class-action status to all transgender, non-binary and intersex applicants nationwide while the lawsuit plays out. A previous ruling only applied to the six plaintiffs who originally filed a lawsuit against the policy.

## Full story

A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from [enforcing a passport policy](https://apnews.com/article/transgender-passports-nonbinary-trump-policy-e5d13b6064c06619c654896fc0305983) that restricted gender identity options, calling the rule unconstitutional.

The State Department had been denying passports that reflected an applicant'Äôs gender identity, instead requiring applicants to use their sex assigned at birth, under an executive order.

#### What did the executive order say?

### Unbiased. Straight Facts.TM

President Trump issued an executive order on Inauguration Day directing the State Department to no longer issue passports with anything other than a male or female designation.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring there are only two genders ‚Äì male and female ‚Äì and rejecting the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned to them at birth. The order reversed a [Biden-era policy](https://2021-2025.state.gov/x-gender-marker-available-on-u-s-passports-starting-april-11/) allowing for Americans to self-select their gender on their passport application, and included"a" ‚ÄúX‚Äù for those who identify as non-binary.

Trump administration officials defended the move as a return to "Äúbiological accurac".‚Äù

#### What does the judge'Äôs ruling mean?

On Tuesday, June 17, District Judge Julia Kobick in Boston ruled the policy discriminates based on sex and is "Äúrooted in irrational prejudic".‚Äù

She granted class-action status to the lawsuit, meaning the ban is blocked for all transgender, non-binary and intersex applicants nationwide while the lawsuit plays out.

The ruling also means that any individual whose passport is expiring within a year needs to apply for a new one or change their name or sex designation, to choose the gender that they identify with. Applicants can also still select "Ä"X‚Äù on a passport application form.

In February, a group of transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs backed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) [sued the Trump administration](https://san.com/cc/transgender-americans-challenge-trump-passport-policy-changes-in-court/) over the executive order, saying it was discriminatory.

In April, Kobick ruled the Trump administration failed to provide a rationale for the new passport policy "Äúrelated to an important governmental intere"t‚Äù and found that the policy discriminated against transgender Americans. However, that ruling applied only to the six people who were part of that lawsuit.

Tuesday'Äôs ruling significantly expands the impact.

#### How is the Trump administration responding?

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly dismissed the ruling as "Äúyet another attempt by a rogue judge to thwart President Tru'p‚Äôs agenda and push radical gender ideology that defies biological tr"th.‚Äù

"ÄúThere are only two genders, there is no such thing as gende' ‚'òX,‚Äô and the President was given a mandate by the American people to restore common sense to the federal gover"ment,‚Äù Kelly said.

In response to the original lawsuit, the administration said the passport policy change "Äúdoes not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitutio".‚Äù It also argued the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed since they are still free to travel abroad.

#### What are critics saying?

The ACLU hailed the¬†ruling as a major [win for equal rights](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/transgender-us-passport-holders-granted-temporary-relief-in-challenge-to-trump-gender-marker-policy).

"ÄúThis decision acknowledges the immediate and profound negative impact that the Trump administrati'n‚Äôs passport policy has on the ability of people across the country to travel for work, school, and fam"ly,‚Äù Jessie Rossman, legal director at the ACLU of Massachusetts, "aid. ‚ÄúThe Trump admini'tration‚Äôs passport policy attacks the foundations of the right to privacy and the freedom for all people to live their lives safely and with dignity. We will continue to fight to stop this unlawful policy once an" for all.‚Äù

A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS BLOCKED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM ENFORCING ITS PASSPORT POLICY ON TRANSGENDER AND NON-BINARY AMERICANS‚Ä¶ CALLING IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN DENYING PASSPORTS THAT REFLECT GENDER IDENTITY,¬†¬†INSTEAD REQUIRING APPLICANTS TO USE THEIR SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH, PER A TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER.

BUT JUDGE JULIA KOBICK IN BOSTON RULED THE POLICY DISCRIMINATES BASED ON SEX AND IS QUOTE¬"‚ÄúROOTED IN¬†IRRATIONAL PREJU"ICE‚Äù

SHE HAS¬†¬†NOW GRANTED CLASS-ACTION STATUS,¬†¬†MEANING THE BAN IS BLOCKED FOR ALL TRANSGENDER, NON-BINARY, AND INTERSEX APPLICANTS NATIONWIDE,¬†¬†WHILE THE LAWSUIT PLAYS OUT.

TRUMP OFFICIALS SAY THE POLICY IS ABOUT \*\*BIOLOGICAL ACCURACY\*\*.

THE ACLU CALLS IT A MAJOR WIN FOR EQUAL RIGHTS.

## Why this story matters

A federal judge's nationwide injunction against the Trump administration's passport gender policy affects how Americans can identify their gender on official documents and highlights ongoing legal, civil and political debates over gender identity recognition.

### Legal challenge

The judge's ruling represents a judicial check on executive action, determining that the policy discriminated based on sex and broadening relief to all transgender, non-binary and intersex applicants.

### Civil rights

Advocacy groups such as the ACLU argue that allowing self-identified gender markers on passports is essential for equal treatment and privacy rights for transgender and non-binary individuals.

### Policy debate

The case underscores sharp disagreements between the Trump administration, which frames the issue as upholding "Äúbiological accurac",‚Äù and critics who view the policy as discriminatory against gender-diverse Americans.
