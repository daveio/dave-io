# Transgender and LGBTQ+ Terminology Glossary: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction and Language Evolution

Language around gender identity and sexuality continues to evolve rapidly, reflecting our growing understanding of human diversity and the experiences of transgender, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ individuals. This glossary provides current definitions as of 2024, incorporating emerging terms, evolving usage, and community-driven language changes.

**Important Notes:**

- **Individual Usage Varies**: People may use these terms differently based on personal experience, cultural background, and community context
- **Respectful Inquiry**: When in doubt, ask individuals how they identify and what terms they prefer
- **Ongoing Evolution**: This terminology continues to develop as communities grow and understanding deepens
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Some terms have specific cultural origins and should be used respectfully

## Core Gender Identity Terms

### Cisgender

**Definition**: A person whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth.

**Examples**: Someone assigned female at birth who identifies as a woman; someone assigned male at birth who identifies as a man.

**Usage Notes**: The term "cisgender" provides a non-othering way to describe non-transgender people, avoiding terminology that positions transgender as "other" or "abnormal." It was coined by transgender activists and allies to create parallel language.

**Etymology**: From the Latin prefix "cis-" meaning "on this side of," parallel to "trans-" meaning "across" or "beyond."

### Transgender (Trans)

**Definition**: An umbrella term for people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.

**Scope**: Includes trans men, trans women, non-binary people, genderqueer individuals, and others whose gender identity doesn't align with their assigned sex. Some non-binary people identify as transgender, while others may not.

**Current Usage (2024)**: Increasingly used as a broad, inclusive term. Major medical organizations (APA, WPATH) recognize transgender as a natural aspect of human diversity, not a mental illness.

**Important Note**: Being transgender is not dependent on medical transition, legal changes, or any particular gender expression.

### Transgender Man/Trans Man

**Definition**: A man who was assigned female at birth.

**Preferred Language**: "Trans man" (two words) is generally preferred over "transman" (one word). Use "transgender man" in formal contexts.

**Outdated Terms**: FTM (female-to-male) is considered outdated by many, as it emphasizes assigned sex rather than identity.

**Respectful Usage**: Refer to trans men simply as "men" in most contexts. The "trans" qualifier is only relevant when specifically discussing transgender experiences.

### Transgender Woman/Trans Woman

**Definition**: A woman who was assigned male at birth.

**Preferred Language**: "Trans woman" (two words) is generally preferred over "transwoman" (one word). Use "transgender woman" in formal contexts.

**Outdated Terms**: MTF (male-to-female) is considered outdated by many, as it emphasizes assigned sex rather than identity.

**Respectful Usage**: Refer to trans women simply as "women" in most contexts. The "trans" qualifier is only relevant when specifically discussing transgender experiences.

### Non-binary

**Definition**: An umbrella term for gender identities that exist outside the traditional male-female binary system.

**Scope**: Encompasses many specific identities including agender, genderfluid, bigender, demigender, and others. About 11% of LGBTQ adults identify as non-binary (Williams Institute, 2021).

**Cultural Context**: While the term is relatively recent, non-binary gender experiences have existed across cultures and throughout history.

**Legal Recognition**: Growing number of jurisdictions offer non-binary gender markers on official documents.

### Agender

**Definition**: A gender identity characterized by the absence of gender or a neutral gender identity.

**Variations**: Some agender individuals experience no gender at all, while others feel their gender is neutral or void. This can be a stable identity or fluctuate over time.

**Community**: Active online and offline communities provide support and resources for agender individuals.

### Genderqueer

**Definition**: A gender identity that challenges or rejects traditional gender categories and expectations.

**Historical Context**: One of the earlier terms for non-binary experiences, dating back to the 1990s. Often used interchangeably with non-binary, though some people prefer one term over the other.

**Expression**: Genderqueer individuals may express their gender in ways that deliberately challenge social norms or blend traditionally masculine and feminine elements.

### Genderfluid

**Definition**: A gender identity that changes or fluctuates over time or in different contexts.

**Experience**: May involve feeling more masculine some days and more feminine others, or shifting between different non-binary identities. The timing and nature of these shifts varies greatly between individuals.

**Recognition**: Increasingly recognized in research and clinical settings as a valid and stable identity, even though the gender experience itself is fluid.

## Medical and Transition-Related Terms

### Gender Dysphoria

The distress or discomfort experienced when a person's gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. This is a medical term and not all trans people experience dysphoria.

### Gender Euphoria

The positive feelings, joy, or affirmation experienced when a person's gender is acknowledged, affirmed, or expressed in ways that align with their identity.

### Transition/Transitioning

The personal process a trans person takes to live as their true gender. This can include:

- Social changes (name/pronoun use, coming out, dress)
- Legal changes (ID documents)
- Medical steps (hormone therapy, surgeries)
  Not all trans people pursue every aspect of transition.

### Gender-affirming Care

Health care and support that affirms a person's gender identity. This may include counseling, hormone therapy, surgeries, or other services that help someone transition or feel more at home in their gender.

### HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy)

The use of hormones (such as estrogen or testosterone) to develop physical characteristics that align with one's gender identity as part of medical transition.

### Top Surgery

Gender-affirming surgical procedures related to the chest, such as breast augmentation (for some trans women and non-binary people) or chest masculinization/mastectomy (for many trans men and some non-binary people).

### Bottom Surgery

Gender-affirming surgical procedures involving the genitals, such as vaginoplasty (creation of a vagina), phalloplasty (creation of a penis), or metoidioplasty (modifying the clitoris into a penis).

## Social and Cultural Terms

### Deadname

The name a trans person was given at birth and no longer uses. Referring to a trans person by their deadname is known as "deadnaming" and can be distressing.

### Misgendering

Referring to a person using language (such as pronouns or titles) that does not correctly reflect their gender identity. This can be accidental or intentional and is generally experienced as disrespectful or invalidating.

### Passing

When a trans person is perceived or recognized as the gender with which they identify, rather than the sex assigned at birth. For example, a trans man being seen as a man by others.

### Coming Out

The process of revealing one's LGBTQ+ identity to others. This is often an ongoing process that happens multiple times with different people throughout one's life.

### Transphobia

Negative attitudes, prejudice, or discrimination against trans people.

## Problematic Terms to Avoid

### TERF (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist)

An acronym for a person who holds views excluding trans women from the definition of women and/or opposes trans rights.

### "Transsexual"

An older term that has largely been replaced with "transgender." Some people still use this term to describe themselves, but it should not be used for others unless they specifically use it for themselves.

### Slurs and Derogatory Terms

Terms like "tranny," "she-male," "he/she," "it," "shim," or "trap" are considered offensive and should never be used.

## Additional Important Terms

### LGBTQ+

Acronym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (or Questioning). The plus sign (+) indicates inclusivity of additional identities not listed, such as intersex, asexual, and others.

### Intersex

A term describing people born with physical characteristics that don't fit typical definitions of male or female bodies.

### Asexual

A sexual orientation describing people who experience little to no sexual attraction to others.

### Pansexual

Attraction to people regardless of their gender identity or expression.

### Ally

A person who is not LGBTQ+ but supports and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights and equality.

### T4T

"Trans for Trans." Refers to trans people who seek romantic or sexual relationships only with other trans people.

## Contemporary Debates and Considerations

### Medical vs. Social Models of Transgender Identity

**Medical Model**: Views transgender identity through medical/pathological lens, emphasizing dysphoria and treatment.

**Social Model**: Emphasizes social acceptance, rights, and diversity rather than medical aspects.

**Current Consensus**: Most organizations now blend approaches, recognizing both medical needs and social acceptance.

### Language in Research and Healthcare

**Person-First Language**: "Person with gender dysphoria" rather than "dysphoric person."

**Identity-First Language**: Many prefer "transgender person" over "person who is transgender."

**Clinical Terminology**: Ongoing updates to medical terminology to reduce stigma (DSM-5-TR changes in 2022).

### Digital and Online Considerations

**Profile Pronouns**: Growing norm to include pronouns in email signatures, social media profiles, and introductions.

**Digital Forms**: Increasing availability of non-binary and "prefer not to say" options.

**Online Safety**: Particular considerations for transgender individuals in digital spaces.

## Usage Guidelines and Best Practices

### When in Doubt

1. **Ask Respectfully**: "What pronouns do you use?" or "How do you identify?"
2. **Listen and Learn**: Accept the answer without questioning or requiring justification
3. **Use What's Requested**: Even if unfamiliar, use the language someone requests for themselves
4. **Apologize Briefly**: If you make a mistake, correct yourself quickly and move on

### Professional Contexts

**Healthcare**: Use inclusive language, ask for pronouns, avoid assumptions.

**Education**: Create inclusive environments with respectful language and policies.

**Workplace**: Implement inclusive policies, provide training, respect chosen names and pronouns.

**Legal**: Stay current with changing laws and recognition of transgender rights.

### Cultural Sensitivity

**Recognize Limitations**: This glossary reflects primarily Western, English-language terminology.

**Cultural Specificity**: Some terms (Two-Spirit, hijra, fa'afafine) are culturally specific and should not be appropriated.

**Global Variations**: Gender and sexuality concepts vary significantly across cultures.
