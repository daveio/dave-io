![Passport on wood table](https://www.pointofpride.org/hubfs/Blog_EO-Passport.jpg)

_Note: This information is accurate as of March 2025. However, policies and guidelines regarding gender markers on identification documents are rapidly evolving. We encourage readers to check with advocacy organizations and legal professionals for the most up-to-date information._

## An Alarming Rollback of Recognition

A recent executive order issued by the administration has introduced significant changes to the way gender markers are handled on government-issued identification documentsâ€”including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards. Under this new policy, documents must reflect a pers'nâ€™s sex as assigned at birth rather than their gender identity.

This redefinition eliminates the ability for transgender and non-binary individuals to update their documents in alignment with their identity, creating substantial barriers for international travel, employment, and legal recognition.

## The End of X Gender Markers on U.S. Passports

Under this executive order, the U.S. government will no longer issue passports or Consular Reports of Birth Abroad (CRBAs) with an X gender marker. This means that:

For many in the trans and non-binary community, this change creates new legal and logistical hurdles, forcing individuals to carry identification that does not align with their identity.

## Legal Challenges and Advocacy

Civil rights organizations and advocacy groups are actively challenging this policy. Legal professionals and advocacy organizations are closely monitoring developments and seeking avenues for legal recourse to protect the rights of transgender and non-binary individuals.

If you currently hold a valid U.S. passport with an X gender marker or a marker different from your assigned sex at birth, it will remain valid until its expiration date. However, it is important to be aware of these changes when considering renewal or new applications.

## Resources and Support

Navigating these changes can feel overwhelming, but you'€™re not alone. Here are some ways to stay informed and supported:

While this policy presents challenges, efforts continue to push for recognition and equality. Organizations and legal professionals remain dedicated to advocating for the rights of trans and non-binary individuals, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to live with dignity and security.Â If you have questions about how this policy might affect you or need legal guidance, reach out to legal/advocacy groups for support.Â
