# What does it mean to be genderfluid?

![](//i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Francis-Kuehnle-500x500-Bio.png?w=105&h=105)

Being genderfluid means that a person does not have a fixed gender identity. Instead, their gender is flexible and may shift and change. It is a type of nonbinary gender identity.

A [nonbinary](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321529) gender identity is one that exists outside of the gender binary, which refers to the idea of gender as being either a man or a woman only.

This article looks at what it means to be genderfluid, other gender identities, and how to be an ally to a genderfluid person.

### A note on identity definitions

_Medical News Today_ uses definitions of sexual, romantic, and gender identities that come from LGBTQIA+ and ally sources.

However, it is important to note that these identities are personal, and people may define them differently. Always refer to a person'Äôs sexual, romantic, or gender identity the same way the person describes it.

## What does genderfluid mean?

People who are genderfluid may find that their gender identity changes rather than remaining fixed.

Genderfluid people may move between different genders throughout their life. Their gender may shift over a day, a week, months, or years.

Because gender identity is very personal and specific to each individual, people may see and use the term "Äúgenderflu"d‚Äù differently. There is no standard definition for genderfluidity.

### Gender identity

Gender identity is a person'Äôs internal sense of their gender. A person may feel masculine, feminine, a mixture of both, or neither. People may also perceive themselves as another identity that falls outside these classifications.

Gender identity is also the name or label people use to describe their gender to others. A person'Äôs gender identity may be the same as their sex assigned at birth, or it may differ.

As people gain a broader range of terms for describing gender, they may choose to use different terms over time to describe themselves.

### Gender expression

According to [Gender Spectrum](https://www.genderspectrum.org/resources), gender expression is how people present their gender to themselves and the world.

People may wish to express their gender through their clothes, makeup, hairstyles, voice, pronouns, body language, and more.

A person who is genderfluid may express their gender in any way they feel comfortable. There is no one-size-fits-all way for genderfluid people to express their identity.

For example, genderfluid people might present themselves as feminine, masculine, neutral, androgynous, and more. Genderfluid people may also change their gender expression however much they please.

## Genderfluid and other identities

People may use the term "Äúgenderflu"d‚Äù to describe their gender identity, or they may use it in combination with other identities. They may identify with another term entirely.

This section looks at some of the other identities that can accompany genderfluid.

### Genderfluid vs. nonbinary

"ÄúNonbina"y‚Äù is an umbrella term a person may use if their gender identity exists outside the gender binary.

The gender binary is a classification of gender that recognizes only two genders: man and woman. If a person is nonbinary, they do not identify solely, or at all, with either category.

The genderfluid identity falls under the nonbinary umbrella. Some nonbinary people may identify as genderfluid if they have a gender that is shifting rather than fixed.

### Genderfluid vs. genderflux

A genderflux person'Äôs gender may fluctuate in intensity, or their gender expression may change over time, according to [Polestar LGBT+ Community Center](https://www.tcpolestar.org/lgbt-labels), a nonprofit advocacy organization.

People who are genderflux may also identify as genderfluid, genderqueer, or nonbinary. On the other hand, they may not.

### Genderfluid vs. transgender

A transgender person is anyone whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.

Some transgender people may identify as a man or a woman, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or another identity.

Nonbinary genders, including genderfluid, fall under the transgender umbrella. If a transgender person has a gender identity that changes throughout their life, they may identify as genderfluid.

However, a genderfluid person may choose not to use the term "Äútransgend"r‚Äù to describe themselves.

### Genderfluid vs. genderqueer

"ÄúGenderque"r‚Äù is an umbrella term for a person who does not identify with traditional gender norms ‚Äî including gender identities, expression, roles, or expectations ‚Äî according to [Gender Spectrum](https://www.genderspectrum.org/resources).

People sometimes use the terms "Äúnonbina"y‚Äù "nd ‚Äúgende"queer‚Äù interchangeably. Some people might view genderqueer as falling under the nonbinary identity, while others might not.

People who are genderqueer may or may not identify as genderfluid.

## Pronouns

Genderfluid people may use whichever pronouns they prefer. They may change over time or from day to day.

Pronouns people [might use](https://itgetsbetter.org/glossary/pronouns-neopronouns-gi-ge/) include:

An example of using they/them pronouns in a sentence could be: "ÄúThey forgot their book ‚Äî I will bring it to t"em.‚Äù

People may also use neopronouns, such as:

For example, using neopronouns in a sentence may look like this: "ÄúEy is over there, l't‚Äôs say hello to"em.‚Äù

## Signs a person may be genderfluid

People may be genderfluid if their gender identity changes and shifts rather than remains fixed.

To help people find out which gender identity feels right to them, [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/article/understanding-gender-identities/) suggests people ask themselves questions such as:

If the answers to these questions tend to change daily or over weeks, months, or years, a person might be genderfluid.

### Exploring gender identity

People may want to try using different names, wearing different clothes, and using different pronouns to see what they are most comfortable with.

It may take a person time to discover their gender identity. They may have to try out a few different labels before they find one that suits them.

If the term "Äúgenderflu"d‚Äù feels good to people, it might be a term they want to use.

### Gender dysphoria

"ÄúGender dysphor"a‚Äù is a term that [describes](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) when a person feels uncomfortable with the sex they were assigned at birth and how other people perceive and identify them.

These feelings may be temporary or long-term, and they may change when a person expresses their gender as they please.

Some genderfluid people may experience gender dysphoria. However, a person does not have to experience gender dysphoria to be genderfluid, nonbinary, transgender, or otherwise gender nonconforming.

## What does genderfluid mean for relationships?

Within any type of relationship, genderfluid people may want to explain to a person that their gender identity is not fixed and may change.

A person may feel nervous about confiding in a partner, friend, or family member about their gender identity, but being fully comfortable and trusting the person will help.

People should be thoughtful and respectful of another'Äôs gender identity and allow them to express their gender however they please.

### Language

A genderfluid person may wish to ask a partner, friend, or family member to change the language and phrases they use to describe them.

For example, a person may want someone to refer to them as a "Äúpartn"r‚Äù"or ‚Äú"pouse‚Äù ins"ead of ‚Äú"irlf"iend‚Äù "r ‚Äúhusband.‚Äù

Instead of gendered terms such as "Äús"n‚Äù"or ‚Äús"ster,‚Äù a person may want family members to refer to them in different ways, "uch"as ‚"úkid‚Äù "r ‚Äúsibling.‚Äù

Offering praise and compliments may also differ. For example, a person may not want their partner to use gendered terms such as "Äúhandso"e‚Äù"or ‚Äúp"etty.‚Äù

### Sex and sexuality

A genderfluid person may have any type of sexuality. They might be [asexual](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327272), pansexual, heterosexual, and more.

A genderfluid person may also have different romantic attractions. They might be biromantic, aromantic, and more.

Every genderfluid person will have different preferences or limits for sexual activities. A person should always discuss what sexual activities are enjoyable and what is off-limits before or during sex.

## History

According to [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genderfluid), the first known use of the term genderfluid was in 1993.

However, this does not mean it is a new concept.

Many cultures have had forms of genderfluidity throughout history, for as long as [3,000 years](https://link.ucop.edu/2019/10/14/exploring-the-history-of-gender-expression/) or more. Many cultures have a history of multiple or shifting genders.
