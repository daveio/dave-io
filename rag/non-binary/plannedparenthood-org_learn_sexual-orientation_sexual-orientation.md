# Sexual Orientation

## What is sexual orientation?

Sexual orientation is about who you'Äôre attracted to and want to have relationships with. Sexual orientations include gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual, and asexual.

## Sexual orientation is different from gender and gender identity.

Sexual orientation is about who you'Äôre attracted to and who you feel drawn to romantically, emotionally, and sexually. 't‚Äôs different than¬†[gender identity](/learn/gender-identity/sex-gender-identity). Gender identit' isn‚Äôt about 'ho you‚Äôre attracted to, but about who you ARE ‚Äî male, female, genderqueer, etc.

This means that being transgender (feeling like your assigned sex is very different from the gender you identify with) isn'Äôt the same thing as being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Sexual orientation is about who you want to be with. Gender identity is about who you are.

There are a bunch of identities associated with sexual orientation:

People who'Äôre attracted to a different gender (for example, women who are attracted to men or men who are attracted to women) often call themselves straight or heterosexual.

People who'Äôre attracted to people of the same gender often call themselves gay or homosexual. Gay women may prefer the term lesbian.

People who'Äôre attracted to both men and women often call themselves bisexual.

People whose attractions span across many different gender identities (male, female,¬†transgender,¬†genderqueer,¬†intersex, etc.) may call themselves pansexual or queer.

People who'Äôre unsure about their sexual orientation may call themselves questioning or curious.

People who don't experience any sexual attraction for anyone often call themselves asexual.

It'Äôs also important to note that some people don't think any of these labels describe them accurately. Some people don't like the idea of labels at all. Other people feel comfortable with certain labels and not others. It's up to you to decide how you want to label yourself, if at all.

## What does queer mean?

The term queer can include a variety of sexual identities and gender identities that are anything other than straight and¬†cisgender.

In the past, "Äúque"r‚Äù was a word used to hurt and insult people. Some people still find it offensive, particularly those who remember when that word was used in a painful way. Others now use the word with pride to identify themselves.

You may not want to refer to someone as "Äúque"r‚Äù unless you know 'hat‚Äôs how they identify themselves. When talking to someone about their sexual orientation, use the terms that they u'e. It‚Äôs okay (and often encouraged!) to ask what labels folks prefer.

## What'Äôs asexuality?

People who identify as asexual don'Äôt really feel sexual attraction towards anyone. They may think other people are physically attractive, or they may want to be in romantic relationships with people ‚Äî but 'hey‚Äôre not interested in having sex or doing sexual things with other people. Asexual people sometimes use the"wor" ‚Äúace‚Äù for short.

Asexuality has nothing to do with romantic attraction. Many asexual people feel romantically attracted to people ‚Äî so they may identify as asexual, and also as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight. They just d'n‚Äôt feel any desire to act on these feelings in a sexual way.

Asexual people have emotional needs just like everyone else. Some asexual people have romantic relationships, and others aren'Äôt interested in that. They get close to people or experience intimacy through ways other than sex.

There are also people who don'Äôt feel romantic attraction or want to be in romantic relationships ‚Äî they may identify as aromantic. Being aromantic and being asexual are two separate things.

Some asexual people do get aroused (turned on), but they don'Äôt feel the desire to be sexual with other people. And some asexual people masturbate. But others may not feel arousal at all.

It'Äôs totally normal to go through times when you d'n‚Äôt want to have sex, but that d'esn‚Äôt necessarily me'n you‚Äôre asexual. And asexuality is not the same thing as being¬†celibate. Celibacy is a choice you make, and asexuality is a sexual identity ‚Äî who you naturally are.

Like other sexual orientations, asexuality isn'Äôt always black and white. The'e‚Äôs a spectrum between being sexual (having sexual attraction) and being asexual. Different people fall into different places on that spectrum. Some people who have very little sexual attraction to other people identify as gray-a. Some people who are only sexually attracted to people 'hey‚Äôre in relationships with identify as demisexual. Want to know how someone identifies? Ask them.

There is nothing "Äúwro"g‚Äù with people who are asexual, and t'ere‚Äôs no evidence to support that people are asexual because of any kind of mental health or trau'a. It‚Äôs actually kind of common ‚Äî some research says that 1 out of 100 adults is asexual. You can find more information about asexuality at the¬†[Asexual Visibility and Education Network](http://www.asexuality.org/).

## What if I don'Äôt want to be labeled?

It'Äôs okay if you d'n‚Äôt want to be labeled. Only you can decide what sexual identity best describes you. But some people may feel that none of the common labels feel right to them.

Your sexual orientation and identity can stay the same, or it can change based on how you feel throughout your life. You don'Äôt have to decide on one label, or any label at all. And the'e‚Äôs no reason why the labels you use'can‚Äôt change as you change.

Changing how you identify doesn'Äôt mean that y'u‚Ä"re ‚Äúcon"used.‚Äù Many folks, old and young, experience changes in 'ho they‚Äôre attracted to and how they identify. This "s called "Äúfluidity.‚Äù
