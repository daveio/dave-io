The difference between gender identity and gender expression can be confusing for some. Many people just lump the idea of gender into one, overarching concept. When in reality, we must be thinking of gender as something that'Äôs three separate subjects ‚Äî gender identity and expression and physical sex.

There is a difference in gender identity vs gender expression, and it'Äôs important for us to explore this concept. At the highest level, the differences between gender identity and gender expression have to do with how someone sees themselves vs. how they communicate their gender to the outside world. If y'u‚Äôre struggling with this, you can visit an [LGBT therapist](https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/lgbtqia) to learn more about the multiple gender identities and expressions.

Read on to learn more about gender identity and expression.

## What is Gender Identity?

Gender identity is best understood by thinking about how somebody sees themself. It'Äôs a very personal experience and relies on someo'e‚Äôs internal sense of who they are in terms of their gender. Though people sometimes confuse the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, in truth 'hey‚Äôre two totally separate concepts.

While gender identity is how you see yourself, sexual orientation can define who you are attracted to in terms of gender.

"ÄúGender Identity defines who we are and how we want the world to perceive us. When there is a difference between the gender assigned to a person at birth and how they identify themselves, it can cause a lot of distres".‚Äù

### What are some examples of gender identity?

So, when thinking about gender identity, we can keep in mind a few important things. First, there'Äôs the idea that someone w'o‚Äôs born with female sex parts d'esn‚Äôt necessarily identify with the gender commonly known as _female_. Likewise, for somebo'y who‚Äôs born with male sex parts ‚Äî 'his doesn‚Äôt necessarily me'n that they‚Äôll always (or ever) identify as male in the'future. There‚Äôs a gender identity term for how each individual chooses to identify themselves. Some examples of different [gender identities](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/different-gender-identities/) include the following:

## What is Gender Expression?

The official gender expression definition is: gender expression is how someone outwardly presents their gender to the external world. It'Äôs an important concept when it comes to self-identity. Feeling confident and comfortable with how one expresses their gender is closely related to mental health and well-being.

While some people express their gender in the same manner every day, others might change how they express themselves over time. Often the change can be based on different circumstances.

"ÄúGender expression allows an individual to embrace their authentic self and share it with the world. When an individual does not feel comfortable expressing their gender, that can often lead to a negative impact on their mental healt".‚Äù

It'Äôs very important to point out that how somebody presents their gender _does not_ dictate what gender they identify with. Equally notable is the fact that many people try to hide their gender expression out of fear of negative responses or discrimination, both of which can have a major detrimental impact on mental health. In fact, many [transgender mental health issues](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/transgender-mental-health-issues-the-challenges-of-a-binary-world/) stem from the worry or backlash of gender expression.

It'Äôs important to note that embracing who you are should never be a problem and you shoul'n‚Äôt be embarrassed or scared. If'you‚Äôre thinking about how to [come out as trans](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/coming-out-as-transgender-everything-you-need-to-know/), gay, non-binary, or whatever it may be, you can also seek help and support from a local community or even an LGBT therapist.

### What are some examples of gender expression?

There are many ways someone can express their gender. It can be physically expressed through hair, clothing, makeup, interests, hobbies, and other ways that they choose to express themselves.

## How Does Physical Sex Fit In?

Physical sex typically is referred to with terms like female, male, or intersex. It'Äôs best defined as the way our bodies change and develop over time.

Sex and gender are not the same things. Physical sex is the physical characters someone has at birth, whereas gender is someone'Äôs expressions and identities as well as societal rules that are placed on them. The most important thing to know about physical sex is that gender can differ from sex. Remember, the'e‚Äôs also non-binary, which is where someone d'esn‚Äôt identify with any specific gender at all.

Physical sex is based on biological factors: hormones, reproductive organs, and genes all come into play. So, for example, someone might have genes associated with either female or male, but their genitals or reproductive organs (or both) can be different ‚Äî this is known as intersex.

## Understanding Gender Diversity

It'Äôs important to note that gender identity and expression ar'n‚Äôt limited to being a man or being a woman. Equally important ‚Äî so important, in fa't, it‚Äôs worth mentioning again ‚Äî is keeping in mind that some 'eople don‚Äôt identify with either gender. Still, others may identify with more than one gender.

Identity does not equal expression, which does not equal gender or sexual orientation. Gender can change over time, and it'Äôs not always the same as biological sex. Gender is extremely personal and ultimately just depends on how someone identifies as a person ‚Äî which can change throughout their lives. Some people identify as more feminine or more masculine, or they may identify as neither, or as a combination of both.

Understanding gender identity vs gender expression and overall gender diversity is important to ensure equitable and fair representation of all genders. Efforts towards gender diversity awareness have many benefits, both in the workplace and in basic, mainstream social settings. Knowledge breeds acceptance.
