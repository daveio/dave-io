The language of queer identity is constantly evolving and expanding, and there will always be new terminology to learn. Pride Month is the perfect opportunity to increase understanding and awareness of the kind of emerging and newly prominent terms that we’re constantly adding to our [Gender and Sexuality Dictionary](https://www.dictionary.com/e/gender-sexuality/).

Language is an important part of how queer people, and particularly nonbinary and trans people, express and define their experience and who they are, whether it’s through the use of new terms or new applications of existing terms.

Finding or coining the term that precisely reflects personal experience and identity can help a person to feel seen, accepted, or understood. It can be liberating and empowering both individually and in a way that creates community. And learning these terms helps to promote inclusion and respect.

The explanations of the terms provided here are meant to capture the ways that most people use them. But it’s important to note that many of these terms can be and are applied in different—and equally valid—ways, with nuances and interpretations varying from person to person. It’s also important to emphasize that this list is not meant to be exhaustive—it simply covers some of the terms that have become increasingly visible in the discussion of the diverse expanse of gender.

## **demigender**

_Demigender_ is an umbrella term for people who identify partly, but not fully, with a certain gender. The prefix _[demi-](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/demi-)_ means “half.” People who identify as _demigender_ may use identifying terms like _demigirl_ or _demiboy_.

_Demigender_ is distinct from _[bigender](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bigender)_, which indicates two genders or a combination of two. The term _demigender_ is sometimes considered to overlap with _[genderflux](https://www.dictionary.com/e/genderflux/)_, which is used by people who experience a range of intensity within a gender identity.

This means that a _genderflux_ individual may experience the feeling of multiple genders on any given day (or moment). The term _[gender-fluid](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gender-fluid)_ is sometimes used synonymously with _genderflux_.

## **femme**

The word _[femme](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/femme)_, occasionally spelled _fem_, comes from the French word for “woman.” It was first adopted into English to mean simply “woman” or “wife.” However, by the 1960s, it came to refer to “a lesbian who embraces identity markers that are associated with traditional expressions of femininity.” This sense of _femme_ is often contrasted with _[butch](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/butch)_, “a lesbian who embraces identity markers that are associated with traditional expressions of masculinity.”

Separate from this long-standing sense, the term _femme_ has taken on a broader meaning in recent years. _Femme_ is now also used to mean “any person who adopts a feminine appearance, manner, or persona.” This meaning of _femme_ is inclusive of all genders with a feminine aspect—it may be used by someone who identifies as a trans woman or a _demigirl_, for example.

## **xenogender**

When it comes to expressions of gender, there are many terms that go “beyond the binary” of masculine and feminine identities. One example is _xenogender_, an umbrella term for nonbinary genders that do not relate to the categories of “female” or “male.” Such gender identities are often expressed by attaching _-gender_ to a word (often a noun) that’s representative of it, like an animal, concept, or symbol, such as _staticgender_ or _sciencegender_.

The combining form _[xeno-](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/xeno-?s=ts)_ means “alien” or “strange,” from the Greek _xénos_, meaning “stranger, guest.” _Xenogender_ is meant to indicate a person’s sense of their gender as being completely unrelated to typical gender identities. Early uses of the term _xenogender_ are thought to have emerged around 2017, with an increase in use beginning around 2020. Still, awareness of the term is relatively low.

## **neutrois**

Like _xenogender_, _[neutrois](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/neutrois)_ refers to a gender identity that does not relate to male or female identities. _Neutrois_ people are non-gendered and may transition away from having physical signifiers traditionally associated with gender expression. This is distinct from an _[androgynous](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/androgynous)_ identity, in which a person has “both masucline and feminine gender characteristics.” According to _Neutrois Outpost_, a website dedicated to _neutrois_ people, the word _neutrois_ was coined by H.A. Burnham in the 1990s. The origin of _neutrois_ is unclear, but it is likely related to the French _neutre_, meaning “neuter, neither masculine nor feminine,” and _trois_, “three,” a reference to it representing a [third gender](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/third-gender).

## **aporagender**

Another nonbinary gender identity is _aporagender_. _Aporagender_ is distinct from male, female, or any gender along the binary spectrum, but still involves experiencing a strong gender identity. Like _xenogender_ identities, _aporagender_ identities are connected to an identity beyond a binary. This makes _aporagender_ people different from _neutrois_ people in that they have a gender identity.

The word _aporagender_ is thought to have been coined in 2014 by a user of the website Tumblr. The _[apora-](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/apo)_ part of the word comes from the Greek _apó_, meaning “away off, apart,” or “separate.” In other words, aporagender is a “separate gender,” neither male nor female nor anything in between.

## **maverique**

Like _aporagender_, _maverique_ was coined in 2014 by a Tumblr user, Vesper H., who defines the term on their [FAQ page](https://maveriques.tumblr.com/faq) as an “inner conviction regarding a sense of self that is entirely independent of male/masculinity, female/femininity or anything which derives from the two while still being neither without gender, nor of a neutral gender.” In this way, a _maverique_ gender is said to be unique and separate from the gender binary.

The term comes from a combination of the English _[maverick](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/maverick)_, referring to someone who is “unorthodox” or “nonconformist,” and the French suffix _-ique_, meaning “having some characteristics of” or “-like,” similar to the English _[-ic](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ic)_. _Maverique_ can be pronounced either [ mav-**reek** ] or [ mav-*uh*–**reek** ].

## **[gendervoid](https://www.dictionary.com/e/gendervoid/)**

Another set of gender identities that falls under the nonbinary umbrella is _gendervoid_, referring to the sense that there is “an empty space,” a _[void](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/void)_, where a gender identity would be. Those who identify as _gendervoid_ may feel unable to experience gender. When describing gender identity, _void-_ can also be used as a prefix, as in _voidboy_ or _voidgirl_, which are used for a person who identifies with some aspect of masculinity or femininity while also experiencing a gender “void.” The term is sometimes used synonymously with _[agender](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/agender)_, but some make the distinction that _agender_ represents gender neutrality while _gendervoid_ represents a complete lack of gender.

Go Behind The Words!

## **māhū**

Within Native Hawaiian and Tahitian cultures, the gender identity said to be between male and female is known as _māhū_ [ **ma**-hoo ]. Traditionally, _māhū_ people were highly respected in their communities for their knowledge of rituals and healing practices. While historically _māhū_ people have faced marginalization and discrimination, there is growing recognition of them and their contributions to the life and culture of their communities.

## **[hijra](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hijra)**

While there is a variety of [third genders](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/third-gender) in many cultures throughout the Indian subcontinent, one of the more common ones is _[hijra](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hijra)_ [ **hij**–*ruh* ], referring to “a person whose gender identity is neither male nor female, typically a person who was assigned male at birth but whose gender expression is female.” It can also more generally refer to a transgender person.

Members of the _hijra_ community often live apart from other communities. Believed by many Hindus to have particular religious power due to their gender, the _hijra_ are often hired to perform dances and blessings at momentous occasions, such as weddings and births.

## **fa’afafine and fa’afatama**

In Samoan culture, both in Samoa and in Samoan communities around the world, the terms _fa’afafine_ [ **fa**-af-*ah*-feen-*eh* ] and _fa’afatama_ [ **fa**-af-*ah*–**tah**-mah ] are used to refer to those who express both masculine and feminine gender characteristics. _Fa’afafine_ refers to a person assigned male at birth with female characteristics, while _fa’afatama_ refers to a person assigned female at birth with male characteristics. The prefix _fa’a-_ means “in the manner of,” while _fafine_ means “woman” and _fatama_ means “man.”

_Fa’afafine_ and _fa’afatama_ people are particularly noted for their role as a ceremonial host—or _taupou_—during rituals.

It is important to note that _māhū_, _hijra_, _fa’afafine_, and _fa’afatama_ are connected to specific cultural conceptions of gender and, as such, are not directly analogous to each other or other terms used by transgender people.

These are only a few of the many terms you may encounter in the discussion and expression of gender identity.
