# Pronouns and Inclusive Language Guide

## Understanding Pronouns

Pronouns are words used to refer to people in place of their names. They are fundamental components of language and play a crucial role in affirming people's gender identities.

## Common Pronoun Sets

### Traditional Binary Pronouns

- **She/Her/Hers** - typically used by people who identify as women or feminine
- **He/Him/His** - typically used by people who identify as men or masculine

### Gender-Neutral Pronouns

- **They/Them/Theirs** - the most commonly used gender-neutral pronouns in English
  - Used for individuals who do not identify within the male-female gender binary
  - Also used when a person's gender is unknown
  - Widely accepted as a singular pronoun in English

### Neopronouns

Neopronouns are created to provide additional options beyond he, she, and they, particularly for nonbinary and gender-expansive individuals.

#### Common Neopronoun Sets:

| Subject | Object  | Possessive Adjective | Possessive Pronoun | Reflexive |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| xe      | xem     | xir                  | xirs               | xirself   |
| ze/zie  | zir/zim | zir                  | zirs               | zirself   |
| ey      | em      | eir                  | eirs               | emself    |
| ve      | ver     | vis                  | vis                | verself   |
| fae     | faer    | faer                 | faers              | faerself  |
| co      | co      | cos                  | cos                | coself    |

#### Example Sentences:

- **Xe/Xir**: "Xe went to the store with xir friend. Xe made the cake by xirself."
- **Ze/Zir**: "Ze said zir favorite color is blue. The book is zirs."
- **Ey/Em**: "Ey went with eir family. Ey completed the project by emself."

### Other Pronoun Approaches

Some people may prefer:

- **Just their name** - "Please just use my name instead of pronouns"
- **No preference** - comfortable with any pronouns
- **Multiple sets** - may use she/they, he/they, or other combinations
- **No pronouns** - prefer to avoid pronouns entirely

## How to Ask for and Use Pronouns

### Asking About Pronouns

- **Direct approach**: "What pronouns do you use?"
- **In introductions**: "Hi, I'm Alex and I use they/them pronouns. What about you?"
- **Normalize sharing**: Include pronouns in your own introduction to make it routine

### Best Practices

- **Don't assume** pronouns based on appearance, name, or voice
- **Ask privately** if you're unsure, especially in public settings
- **Use the pronouns someone specifies**, even if you're not familiar with them
- **Default to they/them** when you don't know someone's pronouns

### Handling Mistakes

- **Apologize briefly** if you misgender someone
- **Correct yourself** and move on
- **Don't make it about you** - avoid lengthy apologies that center your feelings
- **Practice** using the correct pronouns to avoid future mistakes

## Gender-Neutral Language Guidelines

### Replace Gendered Terms

| Instead of           | Use                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Ladies and gentlemen | Everyone, folks, friends        |
| Guys                 | Everyone, folks, y'all, friends |
| Mankind              | Humanity, humankind, people     |
| Husband/wife         | Partner, spouse                 |
| Chairman             | Chairperson, chair              |
| Waitress/waiter      | Server                          |
| Policeman            | Police officer                  |
