**Demigender** (from _demi_ "half" + "gender") is an [umbrella term](/wiki/Umbrella_term "Umbrella term") for [nonbinary](/wiki/Nonbinary "Nonbinary") [gender identities](/wiki/Gender_identity "Gender identity") that have a partial connection to a certain gender. This includes the partly [female](/wiki/Female "Female") identity **demigirl,** and the partly [male](/wiki/Male "Male") identity **demiboy**. There are other partial genders using the "demi-" prefix for the same reasons. For example, **deminonbinary**, **demifluid**, **demiflux**, and so on. Like nonbinary, **demigender** is also an identity within itself, for people who feel connection to the concept of gender rather than certain genders. Being a demigender "is not dependent on how much (as in percentage) someone identities as one gender; it solely depends on if a person identifies as partially. For some, they may identify with two or more genders while others may not."[[1]](#cite_note-Savage-1)

## Demigirl

![](/images/thumb/8/80/Demigirl.png/300px-Demigirl.png)

A demigirl is someone who only partially (not wholly) identifies as a girl or woman, whatever their assigned gender at birth.[[2]](#cite_note-2) They may or may not identify as another gender[[3]](#cite_note-Queeries-3) in addition to feeling partially a girl or woman. May also use the terms demigal, demifemale or demiwoman.

Alternatively, demigirl can be used to describe someone [assigned female at birth](/wiki/Assigned_at_birth#Assigned_Gender_At_Birth "Assigned at birth") who feels but the barest association with that identification, though not a significant enough dissociation to create real physical discomfort or dysphoria, or someone assigned male at birth who is trans feminine but not wholly binary-identified, so that they feel more strongly associated with "Äúfema"e‚Äù t"an ‚Ä"male,‚Äù socially or physically, but not strongly enough to justify an absolute self-identification as "woman".[[4]](#cite_note-4)

![Demigirl-5.png](/images/thumb/8/87/Demigirl-5.png/250px-Demigirl-5.png)

## Demiboy

![](/images/thumb/5/5c/Demiboy.png/300px-Demiboy.png)

A demiboy, also called demiguy, is someone whose gender identity is only _partly_ male, regardless of their [assigned gender at birth](/wiki/Sex#Gender_Assigned_At_Birth "Sex").[[5]](#cite_note-5) They may or may not identify as another gender[[3]](#cite_note-Queeries-3) in addition to feeling partially a boy or man. They may also define their identity as both male and genderless ([agender](/wiki/Agender "Agender")).

Alternatively, demiguy can be used to describe someone assigned male at birth who feels but the barest association with that identification, though not a significant enough dissociation to create real physical discomfort or dysphoria, or someone assigned female at birth who is trans masculine but not wholly binary-identified, so that they feel more strongly associated with 'male' than 'female,' socially or physically, but not strongly enough to justify an absolute self-identification as 'man'.

## Deminonbinary

![](/images/thumb/e/ee/Deminonbinary.png/300px-Deminonbinary.png)

Deminonbinary, or demienby, is a gender identity for someone who partially identifies as nonbinary.[[1]](#cite_note-Savage-1)

## Demifluid

![](/images/thumb/1/1f/Demifluid.png/300px-Demifluid.png)

Demifluid is a gender identity for "someone whose gender is partially fluid ([genderfluid](/wiki/Genderfluid "Genderfluid")) with the other part(s) being static; an example could be: one part of their gender is 'woman' while the part that fluctuates is 'man' and '[genderqueer](/wiki/Genderqueer "Genderqueer")'."[[1]](#cite_note-Savage-1) In other terms, one part of the gender is static while the other part changes between genders.

![Demifluid-4.png](/images/thumb/1/14/Demifluid-4.png/250px-Demifluid-4.png)

## Demiflux

![](/images/thumb/5/5a/Demiflux-3.png/300px-Demiflux-3.png)

Demiflux is a gender identity for "someone whose gender is partially fluid with the other part(s) being static; this differs from 'demifluid' as '-flux' indicates that one of the genders is neutral; an example could be: one part of their gender is 'genderqueer' while the part that fluctuates is 'agender' and 'woman'."[[1]](#cite_note-Savage-1) In other terms, one part of the gender is static while the other fluctuates in intensity; for example, one part of the gender is 'genderqueer' and the other is 'woman' of fluctuating intensity.

_There is more information about this topic here: [notable nonbinary people](/wiki/Notable_nonbinary_people "Notable nonbinary people")_

There are many more [notable people who have a gender identity outside of the binary](/wiki/Notable_nonbinary_people "Notable nonbinary people"). The following are only some of those notable people who specifically use the words "demiboy," "demigirl," or very similar words for themselves.

## Demigender characters in fiction

There are many more [characters in fiction who have a gender identity outside of the binary](/wiki/Nonbinary_gender_in_fiction "Nonbinary gender in fiction"). The following are only some of those characters who are specifically called demigender, demigirl, demiboy, or similar, either in their canon, or by their creators.

## History

On August 12, 2010, user Bad Patient of AVEN's [transyadas](/wiki/Transyada "Transyada")[[16]](#cite_note-16) posted

I've been thinking. (It's a thing I do. Pretty much all I do, really.) Last night I was lying in bed and thinking about the kind of stuff everyone else thinks about before they fall asleep: my weird sexual and gender identity. At one point I remembered my fondness of the term "demiromantic" and, chuckling, I said to myself that I can any word relate to me if I just stick a "demi-" in front of it. And then I realised that it might actually help me find a word for my gender identity. I've felt for some time that I may have too much of the masculine element in me to call myself agender and feel good about it ‚Äî so maybe it would be a nice idea to call myself a demiguy. Demidude. Demibloke. Just not demiman, tyvm, because I only accept being called a man when you're talking about my body and not mind, and even then I prefer adjectives like "masculine" or "male" to that dreaded noun. Now, I'm not being entirely serious here, as I'm not going to go around calling myself a demibloke and I don't think I'll ever find a term that fully describes me anyway ‚Äî and if I do, my identity will probably change just to spite me ‚Äî but I kind of like those words and feel that they may actually describe me quite well. I'm not sure. But then again, I'm never sure of anything related to myself.

Signed,

Bad Patient the Demiyada

PS The elitist douche in me likes describing himself with terms that are likely used by no-one else. [[17]](#cite_note-17)

In December of that year, a different user in that forum, seeking more information, wrote[[18]](#cite_note-18) that the only place they could find a description of the term "demigirl" was on the yada wiki.[[19]](#cite_note-19) In response, user A Long Time Ago posted

As far as I know, that and demiguy are terms made up by the yadas, so there is no additional information on it. Hopefully, they will get onto the Definitions Master List soon where the terms will get more visibility and then maybe it will spread out into more common usage. I personally identify as demigirl because I feel kind of like an female-agender blend by which I mean that I have no identification as male but have an identification as female that is not very strong.[[20]](#cite_note-20)

"Demigirl" and "demiguy" were added to the AVEN Gender Definitions Masterlist[[21]](#cite_note-21) on Dec 12th 2010.[[22]](#cite_note-22)

By Oct 14, 2011, "demigirl" and "demiguy" had been added to the Genderqueer Identities & Terminology page of the popular blog Genderqueerid.[[23]](#cite_note-23). The blog owner, Marilyn Roxie, had collected data for a survey of genderqueer people that year, (Sept 15th - Oct 15th); nine people selected the "demiboy" checkbox, and seven people selected "demigirl."[[24]](#cite_note-24)

A tumblr blog named demigenders was started in March 2014, aiming to be "a safe space for those who identify as demigirl, demiboy, demienby, demigender demiflux, or demifluid".[[25]](#cite_note-25) Another blog, demigenderpalace, was created in June 2014, with a similar aim.[[26]](#cite_note-palace-26)

In 2015, tumblr user transrants created "demigirl & demiguy flag proposals" which would go on to become the standard flags for these identities. User druxydeity created the deminonbinary flag following the same pattern.[[6]](#cite_note-druxy-deminb-6)

In 2018, Washington state began to allow "X" gender markers on official documents[[27]](#cite_note-Jackman-27), with the law stating that
