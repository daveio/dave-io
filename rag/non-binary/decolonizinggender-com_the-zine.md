## DECOLONIZING GENDER: A CURRICULUM

Decolonizing Gender: A Curriculum is a guided reflection on gender identity, race, and colonialism. Designed for both individuals and groups, this zine asks deep and probing questions about why the gender binary is seen as the "norm", despite people who choose to exist outside of the binary having existed forever.

​

How did the whole world "get" two genders? The answer has more to do with colonialism and white supremacy than you might think.

​

This volume includes personal reflection activities, instructions for group activities, historical lessons, and excerpts from "my gender is My Gender," a groundbreaking personal narrative and comic book from khari jackson, co-creator of Decolonizing Gender.

Decolonizing Gender was created by khari jackson and Malcolm Shanks. This zine is free to everyone.
