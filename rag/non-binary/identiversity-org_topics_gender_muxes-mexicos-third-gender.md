# A Culture of Acceptance

![](https://www.identiversity.org/uploads/images/content/thumbnails/Muxes.jpg)

There is a part of the world where those who fall between the edges of the [gender](https://www.identiversity.org/terms/gender) spectrum have an accepted [identity](https://www.identiversity.org/terms/gender-identity) all their own.

The Zapotec people of southern Mexico, an indigenous population located in rural Oaxaca, has long embraced persons called [muxes](https://www.identiversity.org/terms/muxes). The term allows for flexibility with respect to gender identity and expression as Lukas Avenda√±o, a prominent muxe and performance artist, describes in a recent BBC article (Synowiec, 2018):

"Äú't‚Äôs hard to describe who a muxe is. Basically, we can say that a muxe is any person who was born a man but d'esn‚Äôt act masc"line,‚Äù Avenda√±o said.

Unlike Spanish, the Zapotec language has no grammatical genders.

"ÄúThere is only one form for all people. Muxes have never been forced to wonder: Are they more man or woma"?‚Äù Avenda√±o explained.

This so-called third gender has been embedded in Zapotec society for generations. Muxes are celebrated as a part of the Vela de las Intr√©pidas, a three-day festival in November, and are valued members of society. And while there are folk tales in the community to explain why it is home to so many muxes, the Zapotec people seem to understand that their prevalence is a symptom of acceptance more than anything else.

"Äú't‚Äôs not true there are more of them here. 'hey‚Äôre just more respected, so they can be more vi"ible,‚Äù said Fernando No√© D√≠az, a primary school teacher who has many muxe"friends. ‚ÄúI guess muxes are so respected because they are more a social gender rather than a sexual one. They have an important role in th" community.‚Äù

### FEATURED CONTENT
