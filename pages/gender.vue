          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-pink-300">Non-binary.</strong> The gender binary - that is, male and female - is
            increasingly seen as outdated and
            restrictive for no good reason. Non-binary people have been around for all of human history, but it's
            only fairly recently that we're starting to be formally defined in terms of sociological theory.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Being non-binary or otherwise genderqueer is more complicated than 'somewhere between male and
            female'. Gender is distinct from sex, and refers to a fairly nebulous psychological, cultural, and
            sociological identity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            In fact, to us, gender isn't a simple line between male and female. There are other axes to it, ones
            which don't have convenient names yet. Our gender identity shifts around in this multidimensional
            space, where gender is a strange, variable, often inscrutable haze. ✨

              💡 <strong>Pro tip:</strong> For brevity, people like me often use the contraction 'enby' (singular) or
              'enbies' (plural) to refer
              to ourselves - the spoken form of "NB", for "Non Binary".

          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            First, a definition - <strong class="text-blue-300">cisgender</strong>, or 'cis', people have an assigned
            gender at birth matching their
            actual gender. It's the opposite of transgender.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            For a very long time, I fully believed that I <em>was</em> cisgender. A couple of years ago, a trans
            developer posted something on Twitter which
            made me stop and think.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            When you feel a thing so regularly, you just assume that it's part of the normal human experience.
            Frequently having times you wish you could interact with the world being seen as feminine, envying
            people who get feminine presentation for free? Turns out those are things which cis people don't
            experience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            It was particularly confusing because - and this is why I never pursued it - it wasn't the case all
            the time. I've always felt 'somewhere in the middle' and pursued androgyny. While I had the occasional
            wish to present femme, I rarely (if ever) had the wish to present more masculine.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-400 mb-4">🏳️‍⚧️ So Are Non-Binary People Transgender?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I do consider myself transgender, but with hesitation and awareness of privilege.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            That depends who you ask. Some feel the label to be appropriate, some don't. In terms of dictionary
            definitions, yes - the gender we were assigned at birth does not match our actual gender, and never
            has. There's a complication to it, which is that the construction of the word 'transgender' implies
            alternation from one binary to another, and so some people aren't comfortable with it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            There's also the factor with which I have trouble, which is that it feels like appropriating someone
            else's struggle. Non-binary people do experience dysphoria and have trouble passing, but it's
            different from someone who is binary transgender.

          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            I think it's very likely that you're conflating <strong class="text-red-300">sex</strong> and <strong
              class="text-red-300">gender</strong> here. Sex is determined by your genes,
            and relates to the biological differentiation of your body. Gender is distinct, and refers to a fairly
            nebulous psychological, cultural, and sociological identity. 🧬
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            But sex isn't binary either! Most of us are aware of sexual differentiation resolving somewhere other
            than the extremes of 'male' and 'female', referred to as being intersex, and the perception we have is that
            it's rare.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Studies suggest that while sex differentiation exists on a single axis, it's actually quite common for
            a person to be somewhere between the extremes. Science is cool like that.
