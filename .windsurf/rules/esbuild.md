# esbuild Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for using esbuild as a JavaScript bundler. It covers various aspects, including code organization, performance optimization, security considerations, and common pitfalls to avoid.

## Library Information:

- Name: esbuild
- Tags: build-tool, javascript, bundler, performance

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### 1.1. Directory Structure Best Practices

- **Source Code Directory (`src`):** House all your source code within a `src` directory. This promotes a clear separation of concerns between your source and build artifacts.
- **Configuration Files (`config` or `.config`):** Store esbuild configuration files (e.g., `esbuild.config.js`, `build.js`) in a dedicated `config` or `.config` directory. This makes it easy to identify and manage build-related settings.
- **Assets Directory (`assets`):** Place static assets like images, fonts, and other non-code files in an `assets` directory. This keeps them separate from your code and simplifies asset management.
- **Output Directory (`dist` or `build`):** esbuild commonly uses `dist` or `build` directories for storing the bundled output. Configure esbuild to output to one of these standard directories.

Example:

project-root/
├── src/
│ ├── components/
│ │ ├── MyComponent.tsx
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── utils/
│ │ ├── helpers.ts
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── index.tsx
│ └── ...
├── config/
│ ├── esbuild.config.js
│ └── ...
├── assets/
│ ├── images/
│ │ ├── logo.png
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── fonts/
│ │ ├── OpenSans.woff2
│ │ └── ...
├── dist/
│ ├── bundle.js
│ ├── styles.css
│ └── ...
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...

### 1.2. File Naming Conventions

- **Consistent Case:** Use either camelCase or PascalCase for JavaScript/TypeScript files, but consistently within your project. PascalCase is generally preferred for React components.
- **Descriptive Names:** Choose names that clearly reflect the file's purpose (e.g., `userProfile.tsx`, `apiClient.ts`).
- **Module-Specific Names:** If a file exports a single primary entity (e.g., a React component), use the same name for the file (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` exports `MyComponent`).
- **CSS Modules:** Use `.module.css` or `.module.scss` for CSS Modules to scope styles locally to a component.
- **Configuration Files:** use `esbuild.config.js` or `build.js` for esbuild's configuration to make it easily identifiable.

### 1.3. Module Organization Best Practices

- **Feature-Based Modules:** Organize code by feature or functionality. Each feature should have its own directory containing all related code (components, utils, styles, etc.).
- **Reusable Modules:** Extract reusable code into separate modules (e.g., utility functions, API clients). Place these modules in a `utils` or `services` directory.
- **Avoid Circular Dependencies:** Circular dependencies can lead to unexpected behavior and bundling issues. Use tools like `madge` to detect and eliminate them.
- **Explicit Exports:** Be explicit about what you export from each module using `export` statements. This improves code clarity and tree-shaking.

### 1.4. Component Architecture Recommendations

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Adopt a component-based architecture (e.g., using React, Vue, or Svelte). This promotes code reusability, testability, and maintainability.
- **Atomic Design:** Consider using the Atomic Design methodology to structure components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separate presentation logic (UI) from business logic (data fetching, state management). Use techniques like custom hooks to extract and reuse business logic.

### 1.5. Code Splitting Strategies

- **Dynamic Imports:** Use dynamic imports (`import()`) to load code on demand. This can significantly reduce the initial bundle size and improve page load performance. esbuild supports dynamic imports out of the box.
- **Route-Based Splitting:** Split your application into separate bundles for each route or page. This ensures that users only download the code they need for the current page.
- **Vendor Splitting:** Separate vendor libraries (e.g., React, Lodash) into a separate bundle. This allows browsers to cache vendor code separately from your application code.
- **Entry Points:** Create multiple entry points for distinct parts of your application (e.g. a landing page vs. an admin panel). esbuild will bundle these into separate output files.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1. Design Patterns

- **Module Pattern:** Use the module pattern to encapsulate code and create private variables and functions.
- **Factory Pattern:** Use factory functions to create objects or components. This allows you to abstract the creation process and easily configure objects with different options.
- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):** (React-specific) Use HOCs to add functionality to existing components.
- **Custom Hooks:** (React-specific) Use custom hooks to extract and reuse stateful logic.

### 2.2. Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to configure your application for different environments (development, staging, production). Access environment variables using `process.env`.
- **Path Aliases:** Configure path aliases to simplify imports. For example, you can alias `@components` to `src/components`. esbuild can be configured to understand these aliases.
- **CSS Preprocessing:** Integrate CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less using esbuild plugins. This allows you to use features like variables, mixins, and nesting in your CSS.
- **Minification and Tree Shaking:** Always enable minification and tree shaking for production builds to reduce bundle size. esbuild does this automatically with the `--minify` flag.

### 2.3. Anti-patterns and Code Smells

- **Global Variables:** Avoid using global variables as they can lead to naming conflicts and make it difficult to reason about your code.
- **Long Component Files:** Break down large component files into smaller, more manageable components.
- **Deeply Nested Components:** Avoid deeply nested component structures as they can make it difficult to understand the component hierarchy.
- **Over-reliance on `any`:** In TypeScript, avoid using `any` excessively as it defeats the purpose of type checking. Use more specific types whenever possible.
- **Direct DOM Manipulation (in React/Vue):** Avoid directly manipulating the DOM. Rely on the framework's virtual DOM for efficient updates.

### 2.4. State Management Best Practices

- **Component State:** Use component state (e.g., `useState` in React) for simple, localized state management.
- **Context API:** (React-specific) Use the Context API to share state between components without prop drilling.
- **Redux/Zustand/Recoil:** Use a state management library like Redux, Zustand, or Recoil for more complex application state.
- **Immutability:** Maintain immutability when updating state to avoid unexpected side effects and improve performance (especially with React).

### 2.5. Error Handling Patterns

- **Try-Catch Blocks:** Use `try-catch` blocks to handle synchronous errors.
- **Async/Await Error Handling:** Use `try-catch` blocks with `async/await` to handle asynchronous errors.
- **Error Boundaries:** (React-specific) Use error boundaries to catch errors that occur during rendering and prevent the entire application from crashing.
- **Centralized Error Logging:** Implement a centralized error logging system to track errors in your application.

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1. Optimization Techniques

- **Minification:** Use esbuild's built-in minification (`--minify`) to reduce the size of your JavaScript and CSS files.
- **Tree Shaking:** esbuild automatically performs tree shaking to remove unused code. Ensure that your code is written in a way that allows for efficient tree shaking (e.g., using ES modules with explicit exports).
- **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting using dynamic imports and route-based splitting to reduce the initial bundle size.
- **Image Optimization:** Optimize images using tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG to reduce their file size.
- **Caching:** Configure your server to cache static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) to improve loading times for returning users.
- **Compression:** Enable gzip or Brotli compression on your server to reduce the size of files transmitted over the network.
- **Target Specific Environments:** Use the `target` option to specify the target JavaScript environment. This allows esbuild to generate code that is optimized for the specific environment.
- **Incremental Builds:** Utilize esbuild's `--watch` option and the context API for incremental builds, which significantly speeds up development by only recompiling changed files.

### 3.2. Memory Management

- **Avoid Memory Leaks:** Be mindful of memory leaks, especially in long-running applications. Remove event listeners and clear timers when they are no longer needed.
- **Use WeakRefs:** Consider using `WeakRef` in situations where you need to hold a reference to an object without preventing it from being garbage collected.
- **Profile Your Code:** Use browser developer tools to profile your code and identify memory bottlenecks.

### 3.3. Rendering Optimization (If Applicable)

- **Virtualization:** Use virtualization techniques (e.g., `react-window`, `react-virtualized`) to efficiently render large lists or tables.
- **Debouncing and Throttling:** Use debouncing and throttling to limit the frequency of expensive operations, such as event handlers or API calls.
- **Memoization:** Use memoization techniques (e.g., `React.memo`, `useMemo`) to cache the results of expensive calculations.

### 3.4. Bundle Size Optimization

- **Analyze Bundle Size:** Use tools like `esbuild-visualizer` or `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to analyze your bundle size and identify large dependencies.
- **Reduce Dependency Size:** Look for opportunities to reduce the size of your dependencies. Consider using smaller alternatives or only importing the specific parts of a library that you need.
- **Remove Dead Code:** Ensure that tree shaking is working effectively to remove unused code.

### 3.5. Lazy Loading Strategies

- **Lazy-Load Components:** Use dynamic imports to lazy-load components that are not immediately needed.
- **Lazy-Load Images:** Use lazy-loading for images that are below the fold to improve initial page load time.

## 4. Security Best Practices

### 4.1. Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Prevent XSS attacks by properly escaping user input and using a Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Injection Attacks:** Prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) by validating and sanitizing user input.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Regularly audit your dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`. Update to the latest versions of your dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.

### 4.2. Input Validation

- **Validate All Input:** Validate all user input, both on the client-side and the server-side.
- **Use Strong Validation Rules:** Use strong validation rules to ensure that input is in the expected format and range.
- **Sanitize Input:** Sanitize input to remove potentially malicious characters or code.

### 4.3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Use Strong Authentication:** Use strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Implement Proper Authorization:** Implement proper authorization to ensure that users only have access to the resources they are authorized to access.
- **Securely Store Credentials:** Securely store user credentials using hashing and salting.

### 4.4. Data Protection

- **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- **Use HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
- **Protect API Keys:** Protect API keys and other sensitive configuration data by storing them in environment variables or a secure configuration store.

### 4.5. Secure API Communication

- **Use HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for API communication.
- **Validate API Responses:** Validate API responses to ensure that they are in the expected format.
- **Implement Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API.

## 5. Testing Approaches
