# Kubernetes Development and Operations Best Practices

This document outlines a collection of guidelines, style suggestions, and tips for writing code and managing infrastructure within the Kubernetes ecosystem. It emphasizes clarity, maintainability, security, and performance.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### 1.1 Directory Structure

- **Root Level:**
  - `cmd/`: Main application entry points. Each subdirectory represents a separate command-line tool or service.
  - `pkg/`: Reusable libraries and components that can be imported by other projects.
  - `internal/`: Private code that should not be imported by external projects. Enforces encapsulation.
  - `api/`: API definitions, including protobuf files and OpenAPI specifications.
  - `config/`: Configuration files, such as YAML manifests, Kustomize configurations, and Helm charts.
  - `scripts/`: Utility scripts for building, testing, and deploying the application.
  - `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
  - `examples/`: Example usage of the library or application.
  - `vendor/`: (If using `go modules` without external dependency management) Contains vendored dependencies. Generally discouraged in modern Go with `go modules`.
- **Component-Specific Directories:** Inside `pkg/` or `internal/`, organize code by component or module. Each component should have its own directory with clear separation of concerns.

Example:

my-kubernetes-project/
├── cmd/
│ └── controller/
│ └── main.go
├── pkg/
│ └── api/
│ ├── types.go
│ └── controller/
│ ├── controller.go
│ ├── reconciler.go
│ └── util/
│ └── util.go
├── internal/
│ └── admission/
│ └── webhook.go
├── config/
│ ├── deploy/
│ │ └── deployment.yaml
│ └── kustomize/
│ ├── base/
│ │ ├── kustomization.yaml
│ │ └── ...
│ └── overlays/
│ ├── dev/
│ │ ├── kustomization.yaml
│ │ └── ...
│ └── prod/
│ ├── kustomization.yaml
│ └── ...
├── scripts/
│ └── build.sh
├── docs/
│ └── architecture.md
└── go.mod

### 1.2 File Naming Conventions

- **Go Files:** Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `my_controller.go`).
- **YAML Files:** Use lowercase with dashes (e.g., `deployment.yaml`).
- **Configuration Files:** Be descriptive and consistent (e.g., `config.yaml`, `kustomization.yaml`).
- **Test Files:** Follow the standard Go convention: `*_test.go` (e.g., `my_controller_test.go`).

### 1.3 Module Organization (Go)

- **Packages:** Organize code into meaningful packages that represent logical units of functionality.
- **Internal Packages:** Use `internal/` directories to create packages that are only visible within the project.
- **Interfaces:** Define interfaces to abstract dependencies and promote testability.

### 1.4 Component Architecture

- **Microservices:** Design applications as a collection of loosely coupled microservices.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each component should have a single responsibility and well-defined interfaces.
- **API Gateway:** Use an API gateway to handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting for external requests.
- **Service Mesh:** Consider using a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) to manage inter-service communication, observability, and security.

### 1.5 Code Splitting Strategies

- **Feature-Based Splitting:** Group code by feature or functionality.
- **Layer-Based Splitting:** Separate code into layers, such as data access, business logic, and presentation.
- **Component-Based Splitting:** Divide code into reusable components that can be shared across multiple projects.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### 2.1 Design Patterns

- **Controller Pattern:** Implement controllers to reconcile the desired state of Kubernetes resources with the actual state.
- **Operator Pattern:** Extend the Kubernetes API with custom resources and controllers to automate complex application management tasks.
- **Sidecar Pattern:** Deploy a sidecar container alongside the main application container to provide supporting functionality, such as logging, monitoring, or security.
- **Ambassador Pattern:** Use an ambassador container to proxy network traffic to the main application container, providing features such as load balancing, routing, and authentication.
- **Adapter Pattern:** Translate requests from one interface to another, allowing different components to work together.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Implement a singleton pattern for managing global resources, such as database connections or configuration settings. Be extremely cautious, as this can hurt testability and introduce implicit dependencies.

### 2.2 Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

- **Resource Management:** Use Kubernetes resource requests and limits to ensure that applications have sufficient resources and prevent resource contention.
- **Configuration Management:** Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration data and sensitive information separately from the application code.
- **Service Discovery:** Use Kubernetes services to provide a stable endpoint for accessing applications, even when pods are scaled up or down.
- **Health Checks:** Implement liveness and readiness probes to monitor the health of applications and automatically restart unhealthy pods.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Use a centralized logging and monitoring system to collect and analyze application logs and metrics.
- **Rolling Updates:** Use Kubernetes deployments to perform rolling updates of applications with zero downtime.

### 2.3 Anti-Patterns and Code Smells

- **Naked Pods:** Avoid creating pods directly without a deployment or replica set, as they will not be automatically rescheduled if a node fails.
- **Hardcoded Configuration:** Avoid hardcoding configuration data in the application code. Use ConfigMaps and Secrets instead.
- **Ignoring Resource Limits:** Failing to set resource requests and limits can lead to resource contention and performance issues.
- **Oversized Containers:** Keep container images small and focused to improve startup time and reduce security risks.
- **Privileged Containers:** Avoid running containers in privileged mode, as it can create security vulnerabilities.
- **Long-Lived Branches:** Avoid creating long-lived branches, and prefer small, frequent merges to the main branch.
- **God Classes:** Avoid creating classes that are too large and complex. Break them down into smaller, more manageable classes.
- **Shotgun Surgery:** Avoid making changes to multiple classes when a single feature is modified. This suggests poor class design and coupling.
- **Feature Envy:** Avoid methods that access the data of another object more than their own. This suggests that the method might be in the wrong class.

### 2.4 State Management Best Practices

- **Stateless Applications:** Prefer stateless applications whenever possible, as they are easier to scale and manage.
- **Persistent Volumes:** Use Persistent Volumes to store persistent data for stateful applications.
- **External Databases:** Consider using external databases for managing application state, such as databases hosted on cloud providers.
- **Kubernetes Operators:** Implement Kubernetes operators to automate the management of stateful applications.
- **Etcd:** Understand the importance of etcd as Kubernetes' data store and protect it accordingly.

### 2.5 Error Handling Patterns

- **Centralized Error Handling:** Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to handle exceptions and log errors consistently.
- **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism to automatically retry failed operations.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Use a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.
- **Logging Error Details:** Log detailed error messages, including stack traces and relevant context, to help with debugging.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Design applications to gracefully degrade functionality when errors occur.
- **Alerting on Critical Errors:** Set up alerts to notify administrators when critical errors occur.

### 3.4 Bundle Size Optimization

- **Code Minification:** Use code minification to reduce the size of JavaScript and CSS files.
- **Tree Shaking:** Use tree shaking to remove unused code from JavaScript bundles.
- **Image Optimization:** Optimize images to reduce their file size without sacrificing quality.
- **Code Splitting:** Split the application code into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand.

### 3.5 Lazy Loading Strategies

- **On-Demand Loading:** Load resources only when they are needed by the application.
- **Intersection Observer:** Use the Intersection Observer API to detect when elements are visible in the viewport and load them accordingly.
