    <GenderInfoCard title="🤔 Non-What?" color="pink">
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-pink">Non-binary</strong> is an umbrella term for gender identities that don't fit neatly
        into the categories of "man" or "woman." It's about existing outside the traditional gender binary.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        The gender binary - that is, male and female - is increasingly seen as outdated and restrictive for no good
        reason. Non-binary people have been around for all of human history, but it's only fairly recently that we're
        starting to be formally defined in terms of sociological theory.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        Being non-binary or otherwise genderqueer is more complicated than 'somewhere between male and female'. Gender
        is distinct from sex, and refers to a fairly nebulous psychological, cultural, and sociological identity.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        In fact, to us, gender isn't a simple line between male and female. There are other axes to it, ones which don't
        have convenient names yet. Our gender identity shifts around in this multidimensional space, where gender is a
        strange, variable, often inscrutable haze. ✨

          💡 <strong>Pro tip:</strong> For brevity, people like me often use the contraction 'enby' (singular) or
          'enbies' (plural) to refer to ourselves - the spoken form of "NB", for "Non Binary".

    <!-- Plot Twist Section -->
    <GenderInfoCard title="😅 Plot Twist: I Thought I Was Cis" color="blue">
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        First, a definition - <strong class="text-blue">cisgender</strong>, or <strong class="text-blue">cis</strong>,
        people have an assigned gender at birth matching their actual gender. It's the opposite of transgender.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        For a very long time, I fully believed that I <em>was</em> cisgender. In my early thirties, a trans developer
        posted something on Twitter which made me stop and think.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        When you feel a thing so regularly, you just assume that it's part of the normal human experience. Frequently
        having times you wish you could interact with the world being seen as feminine, envying people who get feminine
        presentation for free? Turns out those are things which cis people don't experience.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        It was particularly confusing because - and this is why I never pursued it - it wasn't the case all the time.
        I've always felt 'somewhere in the middle' and pursued androgyny. While I had the occasional wish to present
        femme, I rarely (if ever) had the wish to present more masculine.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        Self-discovery doesn't have an expiration date. Some people know from early childhood, others (like me) figure
        it out later in life. Both experiences are completely valid.

    <!-- Transgender Question Section -->
    <GenderInfoCard title="🏳️‍⚧️ So Are Non-Binary People Transgender?" color="purple">
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        Transgender means your gender identity differs from what was assigned at birth. Since I was assigned male at
        birth but identify as non-binary, that makes me transgender.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-purple">I do consider myself transgender, but with awareness of privilege.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        In the wider world, it depends who you ask. Some feel the label to be appropriate, some don't.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        In terms of dictionary definitions, yes - the gender we were assigned at birth does not match our actual gender,
        and never has. There's a complication to it, which is that the construction of the word 'transgender' implies
        alternation from one binary to another, and so some people aren't comfortable with it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        There's also the factor with which I have trouble, which is that it feels like appropriating someone else's
        struggle. Non-binary people do experience dysphoria and have trouble passing, but it's different from someone
        who is binary transgender.

    <!-- Binary Myth Section -->
    <GenderInfoCard title='🙄 "But There Are Only Two Genders!"' color="red">
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        I think it's very likely that you're conflating <strong class="text-red">sex</strong> and
        <strong class="text-red">gender</strong> here. Sex is determined by your genes, and relates to the biological
        differentiation of your body. Gender is distinct, and refers to a fairly nebulous psychological, cultural, and
        sociological identity. 🧬
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        But sex isn't binary either! Most of us are aware of sexual differentiation resolving somewhere other than the
        extremes of 'male' and 'female', referred to as being intersex, and the perception we have is that it's rare.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        Studies suggest that while sex differentiation exists on a single axis, it's actually quite common for a person
        to be somewhere between the extremes. Science is cool like that.
      </p>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">
        Many cultures throughout history and around the world have recognized more than two genders. Here are just a few
        examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ◦ <strong class="text-red">Hijra</strong> in South Asia, recognized for over 4,000 years as a third gender.
        </li>
        <li>
          ◦ <strong class="text-red">Two-Spirit</strong> in many Indigenous cultures in North America, encompassing a
          variety of gender identities.
        </li>
        <li>◦ <strong class="text-red">Fa'afafine</strong> in Samoa.</li>
        <li>◦ <strong class="text-red">Bissu</strong> in Indonesia.</li>
        <li>◦ <strong class="text-red">Sworn Virgins</strong> in Albania.</li>
        <li>◦ <strong class="text-red">Muxe</strong> in Zapotec cultures of Mexico.</li>
        <li>◦ <strong class="text-red">Bakla</strong> in the Philippines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-text leading-relaxed">The list goes on.</p>

          <Icon name="i-heroicons-exclamation-circle" class="font-bold mr-2 text-red" /> Even biology isn't as binary as
          we once thought - intersex conditions affect about 1 in 2000 births.
