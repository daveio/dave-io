snippet: Exploring the idea of a microcommissioning platform to connect artists with clients for affordable, small-scale artwork, aiming to counter the impact of generative AI. The platform would focus on quick, clearly-defined art requests, benefiting both artists and clients. Feedback from artists is sought to refine the concept, including questions about viability, features, and potential payment structures.

# What is Microcommissioning?

I've been thinking about what we can do in tech land to address the fact that artists have been undeniably shafted by the rise of generative AI.

I'm exploring the concept of a microcommissioning platform – a dedicated space where people can connect with artists for small-scale artwork at accessible price points (typically £20 or less, though this is just an initial idea).

Unlike general freelance marketplaces, this platform would be specifically optimised for quick, clearly-defined art requests with streamlined processes for both artists and clients.

Artists would benefit from volume and efficiency, while clients would get authentic, human-created work without breaking the bank - and, most importantly, not resorting to a plagiarism machine.

# Is this a good idea?

Before diving deeper into development, I'd love to hear from artists.

- Does this seem like a sensible way to short-circuit generative AI?
- Would this model work for you?
- Could a steady stream of small commissions be worthwhile?
- Would clear scope limitations and efficient workflows make these price points viable?
- What features would you need to make such a platform valuable?
- Is this meaningfully different from Fiverr?
  - Are there any issues with Fiverr, which you think this might be able to do right?
- What would you consider an acceptable cut for the site to take?

One artist has raised the idea of NSFW artwork, too, which PayPal refuse to be involved in. It might be a bit tough to arrange, but adult sites accept payments - perhaps we could use their payment processors.

If you're an artist, please share your thoughts below. I need to hear from you to determine whether this concept has legs.

I'm not here to rinse artists, but this would be a profit-making venture. That's why I ask about what you would consider a fair cut.

# Weigh in

I'd love to hear anything you have to say about the idea, not limited to the questions I've asked.
